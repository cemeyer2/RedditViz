I don&amp;#39;t know. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Edit 3: I get prank calls all the time and know when someone isn&amp;#39;t sincerely interested in a cake.

If you&amp;#39;re bored enough to call around to all the erotic bakeries in the country to ask if you can get a dick cake while your friends giggle in the background you&amp;#39;re wasting your time. Yes, reddit, this is why you can&amp;#39;t have nice things. :( &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Edit 4: To those playing the guessing game of &amp;quot;where does she work&amp;quot; I simply won&amp;#39;t confirm or deny any of them.

I prefer making lots of small cupcake sized ones. The biggest dick I&amp;#39;ve seen us put on a cake was about two feet tall including it&amp;#39;s little hat. &lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;How I got the job: I&amp;#39;ve been decorating cakes for about two years now, as well as a year doing cookie decorating. I applied at this job as a joke and because it seemed fun. I didn&amp;#39;t hear back from them for a year then suddenly one day I got a call and was asked to come in for an interview. It was all a very normal interview process. They carry themselves like any other reputable business. Maybe even &lt;em&gt;more&lt;/em&gt; normal because of the slackers and weirdos that apply thinking that working at an erotic bakery would mean smoking weed and looking at porn all day.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;I love my job but it really is like any other job.

I get a lot of questions from customers so I thought it might be fun to spend a boring Monday at work answering your questions. Some details to get you started:\n\n* I'm a female in my late 20's.\n* I won't be giving out my location or any details that might give my location away. I get enough weirdos in here, I don't need weird redditors as well. Sorry reddit, but you can be kinda creepy. Plus, I don't want anyone thinking I'm doing this to promote my bakery. \n* We'll do anything on a cake. I mean anything. \n\nAsk away! \n\nEdit: I'm sorry, I'm not willing to provide pictures of the cakes we've done here at our bakery. That'd make it easy to figure out where I work. But to satisfy you, [here's](http://media.yellowbot.com/r/650x500/photos/25F-1q71qI_o--/erotic-bakery-usa-forest-hills-ny.jpg) [some](http://kingston.canuck.ca/files/aW1hZ2UvcGpwZWd8L2hvbWUvY2FudWNrL2NhbnVjay5jYS9pbmMvZmlsZXMvNTU4NHQ=) [cakes](http://www.beersteak.com/wp-content/uploads/2008/09/erotic-bakery-500x375.jpg) [with](http://image80.webshots.com/80/4/25/86/2744425860036013812aqBFzM_ph.jpg) [dicks](http://seilamaisonq.files.wordpress.com/2011/07/penis-cake.jpg). NSFW just pulled from Google. \n\nI've also gotta get some work done so sorry if replies are slow. \n\nEdit 2: Finally! [PROOF!](http://i.imgur.com/K5zEb.jpg) Because apparently people thought someone who doesn't work at an erotic bakery would make an ama about it for kicks? I don't know. \n\nEdit 3: I get prank calls all the time and know when someone isn't sincerely interested in a cake. Remember, this is a legitimate business I work at and I asked people to respect that. If you're bored enough to call around to all the erotic bakeries in the country to ask if you can get a dick cake while your friends giggle in the background you're wasting your time. Yes, reddit, this is why you can't have nice things. :( \n\nEdit 4: To those playing the guessing game of \"where does she work\" I simply won't confirm or deny any of them. Again, please respect my privacy. I think I'm doing pretty good with answering every question, so please respect that that's just one I won't answer. \n\nEdit 5: Wow, this got a lot bigger than I ever thought. Thank you everyone for your awesome questions! I've gotta close shop now and head home but I still will probably answer anything I haven't already answered once I get home. You guys are awesome. :) \n\nEdit 6: ~~I'm back and answering.~~ A few that keep getting asked:\n\n* I'm not the one who molds the bigger dicks. I prefer making lots of small cupcake sized ones.

Some scumbag will show up right before we close, which is fine.  I don&amp;#39;t have a problem with people that do this, as long as they acknowledge the fact that the people that work there are trying to pack up and get the fuck out of there.  Unfortunately, some people think that being in the restaurant even minutes before closing time entitles them to stay as long as they want.  Tonight, for example, a couple showed up at 11:45 (we close at midnight).  They proceeded to order a pitcher of beer, an appetizer, and two well-done steaks (which btw, take quite a while to cook).  The server that took the table basically had to wait around for them to leave until she could go, because she had to get payment from them and collect any tip money.  They finished up and left at about 12:45. The icing on the cake is that they left the server a $1.00 tip.  Also, because I cannot start the end of night paperwork before I get the cash from all the servers, I leave about 45 minutes to one hour later than usual, purely because these people have no sense of decency.  &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Many of you will probably say &amp;quot;hey, why not just tell them to get the fuck out&amp;quot;.

The guy ordered a pitcher of beer to start.  The waitress informed him that it would be a better deal to get the happy hour special, he declined, and then tried to send the pitcher back when the girl he was with figured out that he just spent like $11.00 on beer (that she was paying for).  Cut forward to around 12:45, the girl is counting out her money in change to leave on the table while the guy is talking loudly on his cell phone and wandering around the restaurant about how he just got fired from his job as a police officer (which, based on his appearance and demeanor, seemed like pure bullshit).  Rest assured, the server would have gotten a 1 dollar tip (or less) 100% of the time with these people.  &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;So these people in my opinion were out of line.  People that show up that close to closing time and decide to sit down and take their time with their meal turn out to be douche bags quite often actually, and I don&amp;#39;t think that is a coincidence.  I understand that the extra hours are part of my job, and I constantly work them for literally 0 extra pay because of that, but that doesn&amp;#39;t make pulling what these people did any less of a dick move.  To be honest, I am more concerned about the serving staff.  In this case, the girl serving the table makes less than 3 dollars an hour and has to pay out tips to the bartender, meaning that she was more or less taking care of these rude assholes 45 minutes after her normal shift ending time basically for free.  &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;m not trying to claim that everyone that comes into a restaurant late is completely in the wrong, just that they should show at least some consideration for the staff.
