Your headline should match the article's headline as closely as possible, to avoid misrepresenting the gist or facts of the article. Note, the \"no editorializing\" rule does not apply to self-posts. For those, standard guidelines of reddiquette apply.\n\n\u2022 Resort to racist/sexist insults, in submissions or comments. They add nothing to the discussion, and they will likely be removed. If you use repeated hate speech or abusive language you may get a temporary ban from the community. Repeated violators will be permanently banned.\n\n\u2022 Use link shorteners. Reddit usually assumes that they\u2019re spam, so they end up in the spam filter. If you have a comment or submission that you want to be seen immediately, don\u2019t use link shorteners. If you do, sign out and check that your submission/comment is visible. If it\u2019s not, message the moderators.\n\n\u2022 Post users' personal information. It will be removed.\n\n\n**Please do:**\n\n\nMessage the moderators when you report something. Many times we have no idea why a link/comment has been reported, and it just takes up time that we could be using to actually read /Canada. Reports should be reserved for submissions/comments that don\u2019t meet the guidelines- spammers, hate speech, completely off-topic.\n\n-----------------------------------------------------\n\nThe moderators of r/Canada reserve the right to moderate posts and comments at their discretion, with regard to their perception of the suitability of said posts and comments for this subreddit.
