Some scumbag will show up right before we close, which is fine.  I don&amp;#39;t have a problem with people that do this, as long as they acknowledge the fact that the people that work there are trying to pack up and get the fuck out of there.  Unfortunately, some people think that being in the restaurant even minutes before closing time entitles them to stay as long as they want.  Tonight, for example, a couple showed up at 11:45 (we close at midnight).  They proceeded to order a pitcher of beer, an appetizer, and two well-done steaks (which btw, take quite a while to cook).  The server that took the table basically had to wait around for them to leave until she could go, because she had to get payment from them and collect any tip money.  They finished up and left at about 12:45. The icing on the cake is that they left the server a $1.00 tip.  Also, because I cannot start the end of night paperwork before I get the cash from all the servers, I leave about 45 minutes to one hour later than usual, purely because these people have no sense of decency.  &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Many of you will probably say &amp;quot;hey, why not just tell them to get the fuck out&amp;quot;.

The guy ordered a pitcher of beer to start.  The waitress informed him that it would be a better deal to get the happy hour special, he declined, and then tried to send the pitcher back when the girl he was with figured out that he just spent like $11.00 on beer (that she was paying for).  Cut forward to around 12:45, the girl is counting out her money in change to leave on the table while the guy is talking loudly on his cell phone and wandering around the restaurant about how he just got fired from his job as a police officer (which, based on his appearance and demeanor, seemed like pure bullshit).  Rest assured, the server would have gotten a 1 dollar tip (or less) 100% of the time with these people.  &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;So these people in my opinion were out of line.  People that show up that close to closing time and decide to sit down and take their time with their meal turn out to be douche bags quite often actually, and I don&amp;#39;t think that is a coincidence.  I understand that the extra hours are part of my job, and I constantly work them for literally 0 extra pay because of that, but that doesn&amp;#39;t make pulling what these people did any less of a dick move.  To be honest, I am more concerned about the serving staff.  In this case, the girl serving the table makes less than 3 dollars an hour and has to pay out tips to the bartender, meaning that she was more or less taking care of these rude assholes 45 minutes after her normal shift ending time basically for free.  &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;m not trying to claim that everyone that comes into a restaurant late is completely in the wrong, just that they should show at least some consideration for the staff. If you are going to show up that late, just get your food to go.

I decided to experiment.  Long story short, my gay co-worker and I got drunk, we went to his place, we made out, he sucked my cock, and I let him fuck me in the ass.  I really, really did not like it.  Any of it.  I tried to fuck him in the ass too, but I really couldn&amp;#39;t even get hard, because...well...men don&amp;#39;t turn me on.  At all.  Why did I try?  I don&amp;#39;t know.  I was young and in a weird state of mind.

We can&amp;#39;t simply donate upvotes to anybody who comes up with a plausible story like faggot_emo_kid&amp;#39;s.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;NOW FOR THE PROOF.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;A simple search through faggot_emo_kid&amp;#39;s comment history causes his seemingly believable story to unravel.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;ol&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;faggot_emo_kid has a history of begging for upvotes (&lt;a href=\"http://www.reddit.com/r/circlejerk/comments/kn4xe/dae_experience_basic_human_emotions/c2lq5mc\"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"http://www.reddit.com/r/circlejerk/comments/le73i/its_simple_we_downvote_the_batman/c2rz82r\"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;He claims to have a &lt;a href=\"http://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/kxhw9/what_is_one_thing_you_suffer_from_that_other/c2o1vcy?context=3\"&gt;stammering problem&lt;/a&gt;.

Surely he wouldn&amp;#39;t consider covering his epidermis with oil, exacerbating it? (also, &lt;a href=\"http://www.reddit.com/r/amiugly/comments/jwau5/so_what_i_am_like_people_18_male/c2fnxv0?context=3\"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Finally, &lt;strong&gt;the webwork of lies about his/her identity&lt;/strong&gt;. faggot_emo_kid claims to be &lt;a href=\"http://www.reddit.com/r/circlejerk/comments/kn4xe/dae_experience_basic_human_emotions/c2lq5mc?context=3\"&gt;gay&lt;/a&gt; and a &lt;a href=\"http://www.reddit.com/r/circlejerk/comments/k41cm/if_elected_i_will_make_hot_girls_have_sex_with/c2hgjvr?context=3\"&gt;chick&lt;/a&gt; (also using this to ask for upvotes), but here s/he &lt;a href=\"http://www.reddit.com/r/pics/comments/jtu08/muslim_punk/c2f2rgo\"&gt;claims to get lots of dick&lt;/a&gt;. Well, which is it????&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ol&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Based upon these inconsistencellencies alone, &lt;strong&gt;it should be clear to anybody that faggot_emo_kid&amp;#39;s story cannot be trusted. If you send him/her(?) your upvotes, you&amp;#39;re throwing them away.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But that&amp;#39;s not all. Here&amp;#39;s the most damning evidence that faggot_emo_kid is actually &lt;em&gt;part of a sockpuppet network of Nigerian scam artists who defraud people of upvotes with seemingly plausible stories&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Check out user &lt;a href=\"http://www.reddit.com/user/GIVEMEFUCKINGUPVOTES\"&gt;GIVEMEFUCKINGUPVOTES&lt;/a&gt;, obviously a throwaway of faggot_emo_kid&amp;#39;s used to whip up a tornado of ponzi-style upvote theft.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=\"http://www.reddit.com/r/circlejerk/comments/l1zwx/check_out_my_witty_and_clever_novelty_account_im/\"&gt;In this thread&lt;/a&gt; faggot_emo_kid throws spurious accusations against GIVEMEFUCKINGUPVOTES, in a thinly-veiled attempt to muster up sympathy for the latter. What happened? GIVEMEFUCKINGUPVOTES walked away with as many as 933 upvotes, &lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href=\"http://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/l74vn/what_is_the_worst_thing_youve_ever_done_for_money/c2qfudd\"&gt;later claiming that he made his (sockpuppet) account simply for the money&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;If this information has not already convinced you, then this phrase in italics&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;strong&gt;this clause in bold&lt;/strong&gt;, &lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;THEN BOLD ITALICS&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;, completed with a &lt;del&gt;stupid&lt;/del&gt; clever use of strikethrough, surely should.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Now faggot_emo_kid is set to walk away with over 1000 more upvotes with his phony story. He has yet to post a video of his streaking, and has barely commented on the thread. He makes up stories to garner sympathy, begs for upvotes, and Redditors, thinking that they&amp;#39;re doing good or helping somebody out, take the bait-- hook, line, and sinker.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;But obviously he&amp;#39;s a logical fallacy&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Look, you&amp;#39;re welcome to piss your upvotes away if you want, but I thought that I might provide this public service announcement for those who are a bit more suspicious of Internet hoaxes than the general Redditor. And MODS, please try to VERIFY these stories BEFORE they hit the front page. We can&amp;#39;t let Reddit be overrun by SCAMS.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;FINALLY, a simple Google search for &amp;quot;Make Good Gift,&amp;quot; a clear anagram of &amp;quot;Faggot Emo Kid&amp;quot; (COINCIDENCE? I think not), reveals &lt;a href=\"http://bloximages.chicago2.vip.townnews.com/auburnpub.com/content/tncms/assets/v3/editorial/a/9c/a9cdf182-fe43-11df-a77d-001cc4c002e0/4cf7e8297b8a8.preview-300.jpg\"&gt;this man&lt;/a&gt; to be behind the game of smoke and mirrors.

You just gave all your upvotes to &lt;strong&gt;Rupert Murdoch&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;HERE&amp;#39;S WHAT WE CAN DO:&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;It&amp;#39;s not too late. You still have 24 hours under U.S. Code \u00a7 B-314 to cancel your upvotes. You can do so by disabling custom CSS styles in your Reddit preferences, returning to the &lt;a href=\"http://www.reddit.com/r/circlejerk/comments/lljmi/if_this_gets_1000_upvotes_i_will_cover_myself_in/\"&gt;original thread&lt;/a&gt;, and downvoting it. Or, you can simply go to faggot_emo_kid&amp;#39;s user page and downvote it there. If you do not do this in 24 hours, your upvote will be lost forever. The choice is yours.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;tl;dr Nope, Chuck Testa.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Edit: typoes&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Edit 2: added moar bold&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Edit 3: &lt;del&gt;THANK YOU REDDIT.&lt;/del&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;EDIT 4: THANK YOU REDDIT.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Edit 5: Edit 6: &lt;strong&gt;We&amp;#39;re doing something powerful, Reddit.&lt;/strong&gt; Already 100 Redditors have reclaimed their upvotes. Keep this on the front page so that Redditors who may have contributed karma without being aware of where it was going can learn the truth and get it back.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Edit 7: An anonymous Redditor has generously volunteered to match each Redditor&amp;#39;s downvote with a personal upvote to their account. &lt;strong&gt;THIS IS HOW WE CHANGE THE WORLD.

We can't simply donate upvotes to anybody who comes up with a plausible story like faggot_emo_kid's.\n\nNOW FOR THE PROOF.\n\nA simple search through faggot_emo_kid's comment history causes his seemingly believable story to unravel.\n\n1. faggot_emo_kid has a history of begging for upvotes ([here](http://www.reddit.com/r/circlejerk/comments/kn4xe/dae_experience_basic_human_emotions/c2lq5mc), [here](http://www.reddit.com/r/circlejerk/comments/le73i/its_simple_we_downvote_the_batman/c2rz82r))\n\n2. He claims to have a [stammering problem](http://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/kxhw9/what_is_one_thing_you_suffer_from_that_other/c2o1vcy?context=3). Why would somebody suffering from a speech disorder caused by anxiety need to run naked through a mall? WHY?\n\n3. [Here](http://www.reddit.com/r/ForeverAlone/comments/kqd0p/as_i_woke_up_today_i_thought_to_myself_fuck_i/c2mhxql) he cites his preference for staying indoors; hardly a likely candidate for baby-oiled public nudity.\n\n4. His extensive [knowledge of Runescape](http://www.reddit.com/r/runescape/comments/kpzqp/selling_mystic_hat_1m/c2m9zez) suggests that he has little experience with either nudity or public places like malls.\n\n5. [Here](http://www.reddit.com/r/acne/comments/kjcnn/should_i_just_continue_using_this_till_i_grow_out/c2krobc?context=3) he admits to having an acne problem. Surely he wouldn't consider covering his epidermis with oil, exacerbating it? (also, [here](http://www.reddit.com/r/amiugly/comments/jwau5/so_what_i_am_like_people_18_male/c2fnxv0?context=3))\n\n6. Finally, **the webwork of lies about his/her identity**. faggot_emo_kid claims to be [gay](http://www.reddit.com/r/circlejerk/comments/kn4xe/dae_experience_basic_human_emotions/c2lq5mc?context=3) and a [chick](http://www.reddit.com/r/circlejerk/comments/k41cm/if_elected_i_will_make_hot_girls_have_sex_with/c2hgjvr?context=3) (also using this to ask for upvotes), but here s/he [claims to get lots of dick](http://www.reddit.com/r/pics/comments/jtu08/muslim_punk/c2f2rgo). Well, which is it????\n\nBased upon these inconsistencellencies alone, **it should be clear to anybody that faggot_emo_kid's story cannot be trusted. If you send him/her(?) your upvotes, you're throwing them away.**\n\nBut that's not all. Here's the most damning evidence that faggot_emo_kid is actually *part of a sockpuppet network of Nigerian scam artists who defraud people of upvotes with seemingly plausible stories*.\n\nCheck out user [GIVEMEFUCKINGUPVOTES](http://www.reddit.com/user/GIVEMEFUCKINGUPVOTES), obviously a throwaway of faggot_emo_kid's used to whip up a tornado of ponzi-style upvote theft.\n\n[In this thread](http://www.reddit.com/r/circlejerk/comments/l1zwx/check_out_my_witty_and_clever_novelty_account_im/) faggot_emo_kid throws spurious accusations against GIVEMEFUCKINGUPVOTES, in a thinly-veiled attempt to muster up sympathy for the latter. What happened? GIVEMEFUCKINGUPVOTES walked away with as many as 933 upvotes, **[later claiming that he made his (sockpuppet) account simply for the money](http://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/l74vn/what_is_the_worst_thing_youve_ever_done_for_money/c2qfudd)**.\n\n*If this information has not already convinced you, then this phrase in italics*, **this clause in bold**, ***THEN BOLD ITALICS***, completed with a ~~stupid~~ clever use of strikethrough, surely should.\n\nNow faggot_emo_kid is set to walk away with over 1000 more upvotes with his phony story. He has yet to post a video of his streaking, and has barely commented on the thread. He makes up stories to garner sympathy, begs for upvotes, and Redditors, thinking that they're doing good or helping somebody out, take the bait-- hook, line, and sinker.\n\n*But obviously he's a logical fallacy*.\n\nLook, you're welcome to piss your upvotes away if you want, but I thought that I might provide this public service announcement for those who are a bit more suspicious of Internet hoaxes than the general Redditor. And MODS, please try to VERIFY these stories BEFORE they hit the front page. We can't let Reddit be overrun by SCAMS.\n\nFINALLY, a simple Google search for \"Make Good Gift,\" a clear anagram of \"Faggot Emo Kid\" (COINCIDENCE? I think not), reveals [this man](http://bloximages.chicago2.vip.townnews.com/auburnpub.com/content/tncms/assets/v3/editorial/a/9c/a9cdf182-fe43-11df-a77d-001cc4c002e0/4cf7e8297b8a8.preview-300.jpg) to be behind the game of smoke and mirrors. But even the name \"Guy Cosentino\" is just another anagram for -- what you ask? -- well, \"Tycoon Genius.\"\n\nThat's right, Rupert Murdoch. You just gave all your upvotes to **Rupert Murdoch**.\n\nHERE'S WHAT WE CAN DO:\n\n**It's not too late. You still have 24 hours under U.S. Code \u00a7 B-314 to cancel your upvotes. You can do so by disabling custom CSS styles in your Reddit preferences, returning to the [original thread](http://www.reddit.com/r/circlejerk/comments/lljmi/if_this_gets_1000_upvotes_i_will_cover_myself_in/), and downvoting it. Or, you can simply go to faggot_emo_kid's user page and downvote it there. If you do not do this in 24 hours, your upvote will be lost forever. The choice is yours.**\n\ntl;dr Nope, Chuck Testa.\n\nEdit: typoes\n\nEdit 2: added moar bold\n\nEdit 3: ~~THANK YOU REDDIT.~~\n\nEDIT 4: THANK YOU REDDIT.\n\nEdit 5: Edit 6: **We're doing something powerful, Reddit.** Already 100 Redditors have reclaimed their upvotes. Keep this on the front page so that Redditors who may have contributed karma without being aware of where it was going can learn the truth and get it back.\n\nEdit 7: An anonymous Redditor has generously volunteered to match each Redditor's downvote with a personal upvote to their account. **THIS IS HOW WE CHANGE THE WORLD. IN BOLD, ALL CAPS.**\n\nEdit 7^3/8: For every Redditor who comments on this thread without realizing that they're in circlejerk, [**The Rev. Dr. Ron Paul**](http://earthhopenetwork.net/ron_paul_constitution_recusitation.jpg) has pledged to donate a copy of the U.S. Constitution to CERN.\n\n**EDIT 8: As a result of this thread, Christopher Lloyd has promised to do a video AMA in the character of Doc from Back to the Future and to promise us that we're all beautiful, beautiful children and that we never have to grow up why don't we come over his place and play some vidya games?

My wife\u2019s really letting me have it.  Apparently if I keep this charade up, my unborn daughter won\u2019t be able to attend college.  If your comment was posted before this I'll still get to you, anyone after that, I'm sorry if I wasn\u2019t able to get to you. Sorry I had to close it so soon, I had not idea it would blow up in just one hour. I was literally receiving 10+ message notifications by the minute.  Hot secretary contest is still going.\n\n**Edit5** Mommabear0816 finally got purple; size is still up.\n\n**Edit6** Fun fact: I now have my credit card number committed to memory. Also, 10 bonus points are awarded to rwheeler720 and RyenDeckard for thoroughly mind fucking me.\n\n**Edit7** Kudos to RobSpewack for finally guessing 34C. Also, those of you who I've pm'd but have not responded: anytime today would be fantastic. I have many things to do, which may or may not include filing for bankruptcy and/or divorce.  Also, you all owe me pics of you with your pizza and whatever it is you did with it; that is all I ask.\n\n**Edit8** Logged on this morning to find a multitude of messages in my inbox and **reddit gold**. The hell people? It's just pizza. My unborn daughter needs to go to college, dammit, is reddit gold an acceptable currency? Those of you who I said I'd get before this tremendously stupid idea of mine ended yesterday, hang on, I'm still wading through my inbox. Also, if you haven't received your gift card, let me know so I can call those pretentious bastards and give them what for.", "ups": 755}, {"permalink": "http://www.reddit.com/r/sports/comments/geehk/11111_cleveland_gets_beat_by_la_by_55_pts_lebron/", "short_link": "http://redd.it/geehk", "author": {"has_mail": null, "name": "awdixon", "created": 1222117983.0, "created_utc": 1222117983.0, "link_karma": 14862, "comment_karma": 6414, "is_gold": false, "is_mod": false, "id": "390jn", "has_mod_mail": null}, "title": "1/11/11: Cleveland gets beat by LA by 55 pts, Lebron tweets \"Karma's a bitch.\" 3/29/11: the 15-58 Cavs crush the Heat, 102-90.

Simple enough. Request one in the comments section. To establish damage control on potential scammers, we would like for you to &lt;strong&gt;post a pic of yourself with a sign reading \u201cRAOP, will you be my Valentine?\u201d&lt;/strong&gt; Also be sure to include your name, date, weight, height, professor\u2019s name, course number\u2014whatever. Get creative; it\u2019s encouraged here at RAoP after all. Take a pic of yourself all dressed up, ladies can do an undressed version, do something funny, or take one with your cat (don\u2019t lie, we know you have one). This is &lt;em&gt;not&lt;/em&gt; a joke or a gimmick, nor are we poking fun at your single status. We just want to see the smiling faces of all the peeps getting pizza.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;One of the fine people mentioned above will contact your (either via comment reply or PM) and request your info so they can give you that pizza we\u2019ve been talking about. If one or more givers responds to you, please calm the fuck down. This does not mean you get two pizzas. The two givers fighting over you will settle who\u2019s gets to do the giving in a civil and cordial manner\u2014either a rock, paper, scissors match via messages (best of three), or a duel on the following morning (one pistol, one bullet, ten paces). To avoid the previously mentioned conflicts. &lt;strong&gt;Givers: if you have already gifted a pizza, please be sure to highlight this in the comments section under said requestor (i.e., pizzad, gave it to this guy, suck it hunger, whatever), so we know they have already received.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Protip:&lt;/strong&gt; If you can decide on the pizza chain you want, know your email address, and have the verification code (see sidebar) ready ahead of time, your giver can get you your pizza faster. After all this is sorted out, you\u2019ll receive your $10 gift card. Like Pasta, I also work and go to school, so I\u2019m actually forgoing sleep at the moment just to try and give a few out before I go to work. Also, we\u2019re employing the 24-hour account rule for this giveaway to further deter scammers.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Couples&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;We haven\u2019t forgotten about you; don\u2019t worry, we want to show you some love too. Since there\u2019s two of you (and if my math is correct), couples get $20 cards. For couples, you will also need to post a pic holding the aforementioned sign, &lt;em&gt;however&lt;/em&gt;, since I don\u2019t want the single people trying to get $20 cards by taking pictures with their mom, sister, cousin, uncle, etc., &lt;strong&gt;your  picture must include you and your significant other showing each other &lt;em&gt;physical&lt;/em&gt; (operative word here) affection&lt;/strong&gt;. Kissing, groping, banging (probably won\u2019t be allowed by the mods, but you can still send them my way if you want\u2026&lt;em&gt;rubs hands together deviously&lt;/em&gt;), whatever\u2014just show us that you\u2019re into each other. Same process, someone contacts you, you send them info, you get pizza. Givers: wash, rinse, repeat.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;As one who is familiar with mass giveaways, I know there will be people clamoring for pizzas like a heard of zombies hungering for human flesh. Not too long ago, I attempted (rather stupidly, I might add) to conduct one on my own. Needless to say, I was overwhelmed in a matter minutes, receiving no less than a dozen messages every other minute. But now, I have an army of dedicated RAoPers at my back. More people will get pizza, more bellies will be filled. And if I told you the combined monetary pool we\u2019ve put together for this event, you\u2019d shit your pants, clean yourself up, change pants, then shit yourself again. There may be many of you seeking pizza, but we are dedicated, resilient, and mere overwhelming numbers won\u2019t stop us.  You will break upon this post as water on rock. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;As King Th\u00e9oden, son of Thengel, said: &lt;em&gt;\u201cLet them come.\u201d&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Also, we checked the fridge and pantry, and we\u2019re fresh out of fucks\u2014we\u2019re giving out pizza, bitches.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;TL;DR:&lt;/strong&gt; Start at the top.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Special thanks&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I would first like to take the time to thank all you givers (27!) who took time out of your day and money out of your pockets to help with this cause. Each and every one of you are more generous than most of the people I\u2019ve come across in real life.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;My deepest thanks and gratitude to &lt;a href=\"http://www.reddit.com/user/RobSpewack\"&gt;RobSpewack&lt;/a&gt; for coming up with the whole Valentine\u2019s Day giveaway idea. If anyone who gets a pizza today feels compelled to pay it forward in the future, give it to this guy\u2014he deserves it. He was the one who originally pitched the brilliant idea when I was mentally toying around with planning a collaborative giveaway a couple months back. If he hadn\u2019t done so, I would\u2019ve ended up haphazardly hosting this event on some meaningless day. Seriously, Rob, I can\u2019t thank you enough.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I would also like to thank &lt;a href=\"http://www.reddit.com/user/DownSouthDread\"&gt;DownSouthDread&lt;/a&gt; who helped me with the promotional aspects, details, expanding the team, and host of other factors I probably would\u2019ve overlooked had he not brought them to my attention. He really helped nail down the whole \u201chow\u201d aspect to this endeavor and I really don\u2019t know how I would\u2019ve figured this thing out without him.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=\"http://www.reddit.com/user/Glinda_Da_Good_Witch\"&gt;Glinda_Da_Good_Witch&lt;/a&gt;. Glinda, oh Glinda, where do I even begin. When I first contacted her she asked how many people I had signed up. I told her, and she replied that she had a few contacts she would try getting on board. Not even thirty minutes later, she messaged me with a list of givers to add to the list. Then more the following day. This woman can round up people like sheep. However she does it, I can only imagine that there\u2019s a fair amount of magic involved.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Last but not least, let\u2019s give it up for our fearless mods, &lt;a href=\"http://www.reddit.com/user/Gadianton\"&gt;Gadianton&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"http://www.reddit.com/user/snang\"&gt;snang&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"http://www.reddit.com/user/Cayuscokid\"&gt;Cayuscokid&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"http://www.reddit.com/user/Rollout\"&gt;Rollout&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"http://www.reddit.com/user/moshimoochi\"&gt;moshimoochi&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"http://www.reddit.com/user/PastafarianTwit\"&gt;PastafarianTwit&lt;/a&gt;, who were gracious enough to lend their hands to this cause. Pasta also deserves our thanks for his efforts in promoting this event and coordinating with mods from other subreddits to get the word out.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;TL;DR2:&lt;/strong&gt; No, you have to read this one too.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Edit: Props to snang for putting up the sweet layout.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Edit2: Work now, might try to squeeze one in at lunch. People I&amp;#39;m still waiting on to hear back on, I&amp;#39;ll check in from time to time. Other givers, have at it.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Edit3: Just checking in on break, looking good so far. Keep up the good work givers. Also, all you foreveralone folks, after browsing all of your pics, how the hell are &lt;em&gt;any&lt;/em&gt; of you single? You&amp;#39;re all gorgeous!&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Edit4: Quick check in on break. Good news for requestors, to be honest, I don&amp;#39;t even think we&amp;#39;ve given away half of what we pooled together.

(e.g. by using direct linking or imgur)\n\n* Want to find where an image comes from? **Search first.** Use the following image searches before asking in the comments or reporting something:    \n\\- [TinEye Reverse Image Search](http://www.tineye.com/)    \n\\- [Google Image Search](http://www.google.com/imghp)    \n\\- [KarmaDecay](http://karmadecay.com) (Reddit Image Search)    \n\n* **Blogspam and posts titled like \"Who is this person?\" are often removed or left in the spam filter to rot.**    \n\n* Submitting your own site, while somewhat permitted, isn't encouraged.\n\n* Occasionally, posts get flagged as spam.  This is normal - please let a moderator know if you find many of your submits are not appearing and you think they should.\n\n* Posting redirected links such as bit.ly could lead to ban.  The purpose of such links is to save room, which isn't an issue when making a post.  That means that if you're using them, there is a good chance you are being intentionally deceptive.\n\n* NSFW is not **NSFL**.  Offending posts will be removed.\n\n*****\n\n**When reporting a submission, please [message the moderators](http://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=%23nsfw) why you did so as it's not always obvious why you are reporting it!**\n\nHelp out \\/r/nsfw by reporting any content you feel contains any illegal content, websites with excessive or invasive advertisements, blogspam, linkjacked content, over-promotion or any other undesirable content.
