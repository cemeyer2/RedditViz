Some scumbag will show up right before we close, which is fine.  I don&amp;#39;t have a problem with people that do this, as long as they acknowledge the fact that the people that work there are trying to pack up and get the fuck out of there.  Unfortunately, some people think that being in the restaurant even minutes before closing time entitles them to stay as long as they want.  Tonight, for example, a couple showed up at 11:45 (we close at midnight).  They proceeded to order a pitcher of beer, an appetizer, and two well-done steaks (which btw, take quite a while to cook).  The server that took the table basically had to wait around for them to leave until she could go, because she had to get payment from them and collect any tip money.  They finished up and left at about 12:45. The icing on the cake is that they left the server a $1.00 tip.  Also, because I cannot start the end of night paperwork before I get the cash from all the servers, I leave about 45 minutes to one hour later than usual, purely because these people have no sense of decency.  &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Many of you will probably say &amp;quot;hey, why not just tell them to get the fuck out&amp;quot;.

The guy ordered a pitcher of beer to start.  The waitress informed him that it would be a better deal to get the happy hour special, he declined, and then tried to send the pitcher back when the girl he was with figured out that he just spent like $11.00 on beer (that she was paying for).  Cut forward to around 12:45, the girl is counting out her money in change to leave on the table while the guy is talking loudly on his cell phone and wandering around the restaurant about how he just got fired from his job as a police officer (which, based on his appearance and demeanor, seemed like pure bullshit).  Rest assured, the server would have gotten a 1 dollar tip (or less) 100% of the time with these people.  &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;So these people in my opinion were out of line.  People that show up that close to closing time and decide to sit down and take their time with their meal turn out to be douche bags quite often actually, and I don&amp;#39;t think that is a coincidence.  I understand that the extra hours are part of my job, and I constantly work them for literally 0 extra pay because of that, but that doesn&amp;#39;t make pulling what these people did any less of a dick move.  To be honest, I am more concerned about the serving staff.  In this case, the girl serving the table makes less than 3 dollars an hour and has to pay out tips to the bartender, meaning that she was more or less taking care of these rude assholes 45 minutes after her normal shift ending time basically for free.  &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;m not trying to claim that everyone that comes into a restaurant late is completely in the wrong, just that they should show at least some consideration for the staff. If you are going to show up that late, just get your food to go.

Clearly it's one of the first and loudest complaints from conservative types, and I think it deserves some discussion. \n\nIs there a segment of the gay community who also feel that people should keep their dick in their pants in front of children? \n\nWould it be entirely blasphemous to keep clothes on at Pride parades? \n\nI know I'm asking some pointed/loaded questions, but I find it a difficult argument to defend against when asked. Someone will say \"why are we paying for this?\" (the parade) and you respond with something standard, and then it's \"For them to walk around with their dicks out slapping each other on the ass while kids walk by in broad daylight? On our streets?\"\n\n... But they're GAY! They're HARMLESS! Is that it? I find it hard to find a suitable explanation. If a stripper didn't cover themselves up when they walked outside, they'd be arrested. If I brought my kid into a strip club, I'd be arrested. Yet once a year we hold a nude cock amnesty in the heart of the city, and not only is it not wrong, it's entirely defensible? \n\nHey checking the spelling for that it's kind of humorous... \n\nde\u00b7fen\u00b7si\u00b7ble/di\u02c8fens\u0259b\u0259l/Adjective\n1.

Should I do that?&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Sorry for not providing more details reddit I came home very late, made this post and went to sleep. This is a throw away but I&amp;#39;ve been a redditor for two years now. So if you care to know, here&amp;#39;s the back story. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;This happened in Temecula, CA, my parents live here, I go to college somewhere else in the state. I came home for the summer. I made a throwaway account for this so my college friends don&amp;#39;t see this, I&amp;#39;m afraid it&amp;#39;ll just start ridiculous rumors. Temecula is a nice community but it&amp;#39;s very conservative and at times racist. Temecula was even on the Daily Show with Jon Stewart because the people are not letting a mosque be built on the same street as two churches. That said, I&amp;#39;ve went to middle and high school here and I&amp;#39;ve dealt with a little racism here and there before but nothing like this. I am Punjabi from India, my family is Sikh, though I&amp;#39;m atheist so I don&amp;#39;t wear the turban or have a beard. \nMy friend from middle school(white guy) moved into a new house. His parents were gone for the weekend so four of us (white guy, half black half white guy, asian, and me) went over to his house to smoke a little pot. I know this sounds like one of those teen parties but, it&amp;#39;s not. My friends and I are nerds, we were the only ones there and we were just planning on smoking pot, eating pizza, and playing video games. \nI had trouble finding the house, it was dark. I see this middle aged white guy, I&amp;#39;ll call him bob, staring at me from his yard. The layout was that of a typical suburban housing area. So I say, &amp;quot;excuse me sir, I&amp;#39;m looking for my friends house it&amp;#39;s number blah blah blah&amp;quot; he says, &amp;quot;no, now get the fuck out motherfucker&amp;quot; I respond, &amp;quot;thank you sir&amp;quot; and park the car a few houses down and decide to look for the house on foot. I should mention I never ended up smoking that night so don&amp;#39;t say you were just high. I call my friend and see him come outside of his house and start walking over in his direction. I walk past bob&amp;#39;s house, but I&amp;#39;m on the other side of the street. Bob, is in the garage points a hand gun at me and says get moving I was somewhat in disbelief, this had never happened to me and it was surreal. I move quickly and get into my friends house. I tell them and they don&amp;#39;t believe me, much like you reddit. My friend who lives there says no way, that the people on his street are cool. I tell them my car is past his house and I&amp;#39;d like to go get it. So everyone except the half black guy come with me to move the car away from bob&amp;#39;s house. This time bob comes out with a huge FUCKING SNIPER RIFLE! with a scope and everything. Loads and cocks it and says &amp;quot;you have ten seconds...&amp;quot; I tell him I just want to get my car and leave. He doesn&amp;#39;t care. He only aims the gun at me and my asian friend and tells us to fuck off while he ignored my white friends. So we go back to my friends house. My friend who&amp;#39;s house it was had already smoked, so I couldn&amp;#39;t call the cops then. I wanted to just get my car and leave. So I waited a few hours then ran to my car and went home and made this post. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I am going to the police station in one hour with my Asian friend to make a report. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I should add, if I write to him I will put a fake return address and ask him to respond to an email address. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Final Edit: The station was closed so I called and they sent an officer over to talk to him. The officer called me back and said the man was just trying to defend his property and they told him not to do that again. &lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;", "text": "I found his address thanks to google earth. I am contemplating whether I should go to the police station and if I do, will they really even do anything?\n\nAlso since I have his address I was thinking I could write to him and ask him if he could explain why he did that. Should I do that?\n\nSorry for not providing more details reddit I came home very late, made this post and went to sleep. This is a throw away but I've been a redditor for two years now. So if you care to know, here's the back story. \n\nThis happened in Temecula, CA, my parents live here, I go to college somewhere else in the state. I came home for the summer. I made a throwaway account for this so my college friends don't see this, I'm afraid it'll just start ridiculous rumors. Temecula is a nice community but it's very conservative and at times racist. Temecula was even on the Daily Show with Jon Stewart because the people are not letting a mosque be built on the same street as two churches. That said, I've went to middle and high school here and I've dealt with a little racism here and there before but nothing like this. I am Punjabi from India, my family is Sikh, though I'm atheist so I don't wear the turban or have a beard. \nMy friend from middle school(white guy) moved into a new house. His parents were gone for the weekend so four of us (white guy, half black half white guy, asian, and me) went over to his house to smoke a little pot. I know this sounds like one of those teen parties but, it's not. My friends and I are nerds, we were the only ones there and we were just planning on smoking pot, eating pizza, and playing video games. \nI had trouble finding the house, it was dark. I see this middle aged white guy, I'll call him bob, staring at me from his yard. The layout was that of a typical suburban housing area. So I say, \"excuse me sir, I'm looking for my friends house it's number blah blah blah\" he says, \"no, now get the fuck out motherfucker\" I respond, \"thank you sir\" and park the car a few houses down and decide to look for the house on foot. I should mention I never ended up smoking that night so don't say you were just high. I call my friend and see him come outside of his house and start walking over in his direction. I walk past bob's house, but I'm on the other side of the street. Bob, is in the garage points a hand gun at me and says get moving I was somewhat in disbelief, this had never happened to me and it was surreal. I move quickly and get into my friends house. I tell them and they don't believe me, much like you reddit. My friend who lives there says no way, that the people on his street are cool. I tell them my car is past his house and I'd like to go get it. So everyone except the half black guy come with me to move the car away from bob's house. This time bob comes out with a huge FUCKING SNIPER RIFLE! with a scope and everything. Loads and cocks it and says \"you have ten seconds...\" I tell him I just want to get my car and leave. He doesn't care. He only aims the gun at me and my asian friend and tells us to fuck off while he ignored my white friends. So we go back to my friends house. My friend who's house it was had already smoked, so I couldn't call the cops then. I wanted to just get my car and leave. So I waited a few hours then ran to my car and went home and made this post. \n\nI am going to the police station in one hour with my Asian friend to make a report. \n\nI should add, if I write to him I will put a fake return address and ask him to respond to an email address. \n\nFinal Edit: The station was closed so I called and they sent an officer over to talk to him. The officer called me back and said the man was just trying to defend his property and they told him not to do that again.

The more enthusiastic you are, the more he\u2019ll be enjoying it. From experience (and I\u2019m sure many of you will agree), a smile on your face and a little bit of a laugh is perfect for making both you and him more comfortable and relaxed.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Now there\u2019s more than one way of getting into a blowjob for your man, the first is just to get stuck in and we\u2019ll come to that in more detail later; however my favourite way to start is by being as much of a tease as possible. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Teasing:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Blowing can be an exploration and about getting comfortable with him. I have most fun by drawing it out as much as possible but that doesn\u2019t mean you\u2019ll be the same. Now when I say \u2018drawing it out\u2019, I don\u2019t mean half an hour of your softest kisses \u2013 but at least a good five minutes pleasuring him through kissing, licking, stroking, but not quite sucking.  Be playful by nibbling, kissing and softly biting his skin - vary between this and lightly licking him up and down his shaft. Don\u2019t feel like you have to go in quickly, mix it up a bit, almost like you\u2019re giving him a preview of what\u2019s to come. He won\u2019t know what to expect and that will build the intensity and excitement. Engrossing yourself in him can be lots of fun \u2013 just really get involved, get close to him and stay there.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Get his penis nice and wet with your kisses and begin massaging him with your hands or even in between your breasts, either way getting him as wet as you can. If you try using your breasts he\u2019ll love that its not your hands and the sensations will make him feel really close to you. After plenty of teasing, take him into your mouth and as deep as you can go with him. Slowly begin to lick and suck your way up and down his shaft. When you\u2019re ready (always remember everything you do is your choice and not his), try to experiment similarly whilst moving your hands around his balls and shaft, keeping your movements smooth and wet at all times.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Straight In:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Not all blowjobs have to be long and drawn out, sometimes it can be great fun to tear off his trousers and just go straight for it. If teasing isn\u2019t for you then this might be: some believe that the best blowjobs are unexpected blowjobs, and taking charge of a guy in this situation is no mission. The feeling of domination can give you a bit of an ego boost, especially when he\u2019s moaning in pleasure because he didn\u2019t expect you to do something.  Moaning because of the psychological element that\u2019s added. Know that if he\u2019s moaning then whatever you\u2019re doing is good and you should repeat it as often as you like. If your guy isn\u2019t very vocal, encourage him to give you more feedback. So forget about your hands at first and concentrate on getting everything immediately wet. If you\u2019re not afraid of deepthroating, this is a great time to get straight to it. And if it\u2019s something new for you then I have a few handy techniques to soften the blow...&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Deepthroating:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Learning to deepthroat isn\u2019t a necessity, but it\u2019s a pretty spectacular ability in the oral repertoire. It\u2019s good to use on occasion simply because it gives men all round sensation, it may even become central to your routine if that satisfies you both. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Relax your mouth completely making sure you are in a position where your throat can be as open as possible. You want to start slowly, keeping your tongue down until you are comfortable with your new surroundings. Engulf him slowly, being careful to not catch him with your teeth and take it to the furthest most comfortable point. Stay here for a few seconds to get used to the feeling and then little by little take more of him in, remembering to stop and get used to how this feels \u2013 this will make deepthroating at a faster pace when you are more confident much easier as well. Don\u2019t forget to breathe! \u2026 don\u2019t rush, the experience is meant to be a slow, luxurious thing for both of you and there\u2019s not a right or wrong way of doing it, especially in a loving relationship where you can laugh it off and get right back to it with no pressure.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Getting past the gag reflex is simply down to practice and it is as simple as that - there are some good guides online which aided me when I had that issue.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;1)     Slowly taking in as much of him as you can \u2013 going a little further each time so he really feels the difference of how deep you can go.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;2)  Suck and hold onto him with the pressure of your lips before quickly pulling off - and repeat. This will involve coming off him completely before going back to him and changing the speed of this will make him feel good.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;3)  Movement of the tongue is more limited the deeper you go. Don\u2019t be worried if you can\u2019t move much with your tongue but enjoy the movement you can make on the areas of his shaft you can reach. This will vary depending on how versatile your tongue is so light flicks and massaging him slowly will feel amazing \u2013 keeping eye contact if you can.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;4)  Temperature changes by either softly blowing cool air or breathing on him. This can be something to do before you start deepthroating, just around his shaft. However, another way of exciting him is to as you go deeper keep your mouth as open as possible breathing heavily as you move. It works as the same vibrations would \u2013 so talking or humming would also work. The different shapes and noises you make with your mouth give various awesome feelings to your guy.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;5)  Change in movement: whilst deepthroating clamp your lips around him at his base and suck slowly as you retreat up towards his tip.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;6)  Let him know you\u2019re enjoying it by looking up and smiling as you release the tight suction you have applied with a light \u2018popping\u2019 sound.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;7)  Don\u2019t be afraid to mix up going deep with paying attention to his tip and other areas. As much as he may like you going deep, make a big deal about coming completely off him before you go down again. You can do this by opening your mouth wide on the way down and then sucking tightly with your lips pressed against him and suck your lips all the way back up to the top. It draws out the pleasure for him and gives you time to think about your next move.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;8)  Gulping while you\u2019re very deep: throat vibrations do a lot of good and it will affect all of him because he is so far inside of you.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Other techniques&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Hands:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Bring in your hands to add something different into the mix and work with what your lips and tongue are doing - your hands should keep busy.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;These are three enjoyable tried and tested positions for a blowjob with hands:&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;1) Not using hands at all from a kneeling position.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;2) Wrapping your hands around the base of his shaft \u2013 best when he\u2019s lying down or sitting back in a chair where you can position him towards you. Good for deepthroating.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;3) With one hand around his balls, slightly pulling them closer to you and your other hand holding the shaft. This can help if he\u2019s finding it difficult to come and can be done in many positions.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Hands are a great for supporting and continuing pleasure when your mouth is taking a two second break and with the correct pressure can add the perfect amount of intensity to a blowjob.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Lightly, massage his balls with your fingertips or cup them in your hands and he\u2019ll feel held, safe and adored by you. You know the feeling when your man holds you and you feel completely and utterly safe \u2013 well this is the same, but for men. Place your hands at the bottom of his shaft and gently massage in a circular motion.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Positions:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The best positions for most individuals greatly depend on the couple, however a few work well for the majority of women. But positions can really give you more flexibility when going down on a man and depends on what you feel comfortable with. Test out the furniture; chairs, tables, use the bed to your advantage. You could:&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;1)  Get him to sit on a chair and kneel in between his legs on a pillow. Good for all over action, getting your hands to his balls and deepthroating&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;2)  Him lying down (bed or floor most likely), this is good for feeling relaxed. With him lying on the bed and you on your knees (or as you wish) in between his open legs at the bottom of the bed. Good for faster blowjobs as you have more leverage, also a good lazy position if you want to curl around him.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;3)  Him standing up \u2013 you could be kneeling/sitting/lying on the bed as he stands next to you \u2013 this is probably best for deepthroating. If you are confident and can get the right height.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;4)  Him putting one leg raised on the bed whilst standing as you\u2019re on all fours/on your side at the correct height/bed. (Good for a change of position from lying down on the bed).&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;5)  Lying down in what would be the 69 position but to the side of him on the bed. Great for him to get to you too and he\u2019ll be able to see everything you\u2019re doing which is a massive turn on.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;6)  If you\u2019re looking for something specifically good for deepthroating (also try on a chair) then him standing next to the bed whilst you lie on your back with your head just off the bed/table/object of decent height, supported by a pillow can give you lots of room for him to thrust as your mouth and throat are at their most open. Make sure you are happy with the amount of pressure he is applying, as this is a trusting position where you both need to feel comfortable. This is fun and safe done sensibly and you can use your hands to stop him thrusting as necessary (also works with no. 3)&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;7)  Not to mention, playing in the 69 position is always fun and you can battle it out \u2018til the end.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Continued &lt;a href=\"http://www.reddit.com/r/sex/comments/dm93o/for_girls_slaving_away_at_a_hot_cock_a_guide_to/c119c7k\"&gt;in comments.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;", "text": "**Hopefully these will be some helpful tips, tricks and ideas that might be new, different or just interesting to read about for those wanting to go a little further than basic blowing.**\n\n\nTo begin with, I want to tell you the best thing I\u2019ve learnt about blowjobs and that is that it\u2019s not all about what you do - it\u2019s the attitude you do it with.

This can help if he\u2019s finding it difficult to come and can be done in many positions.\n\n\nHands are a great for supporting and continuing pleasure when your mouth is taking a two second break and with the correct pressure can add the perfect amount of intensity to a blowjob.\n\n\nLightly, massage his balls with your fingertips or cup them in your hands and he\u2019ll feel held, safe and adored by you. You know the feeling when your man holds you and you feel completely and utterly safe \u2013 well this is the same, but for men. Place your hands at the bottom of his shaft and gently massage in a circular motion.\n\n\n**Positions:**\n\n\nThe best positions for most individuals greatly depend on the couple, however a few work well for the majority of women. But positions can really give you more flexibility when going down on a man and depends on what you feel comfortable with. Test out the furniture; chairs, tables, use the bed to your advantage. You could:\n\n\n1)\tGet him to sit on a chair and kneel in between his legs on a pillow. Good for all over action, getting your hands to his balls and deepthroating\n\n2)\tHim lying down (bed or floor most likely), this is good for feeling relaxed. With him lying on the bed and you on your knees (or as you wish) in between his open legs at the bottom of the bed. Good for faster blowjobs as you have more leverage, also a good lazy position if you want to curl around him.\n\n3)\tHim standing up \u2013 you could be kneeling/sitting/lying on the bed as he stands next to you \u2013 this is probably best for deepthroating. If you are confident and can get the right height.\n\n4)\tHim putting one leg raised on the bed whilst standing as you\u2019re on all fours/on your side at the correct height/bed. (Good for a change of position from lying down on the bed).\n\n5)\tLying down in what would be the 69 position but to the side of him on the bed. Great for him to get to you too and he\u2019ll be able to see everything you\u2019re doing which is a massive turn on.\n\n6)\tIf you\u2019re looking for something specifically good for deepthroating (also try on a chair) then him standing next to the bed whilst you lie on your back with your head just off the bed/table/object of decent height, supported by a pillow can give you lots of room for him to thrust as your mouth and throat are at their most open. Make sure you are happy with the amount of pressure he is applying, as this is a trusting position where you both need to feel comfortable. This is fun and safe done sensibly and you can use your hands to stop him thrusting as necessary (also works with no. 3)\n\n7)\tNot to mention, playing in the 69 position is always fun and you can battle it out \u2018til the end.\n\n\n**Continued [in comments.](http://www.reddit.com/r/sex/comments/dm93o/for_girls_slaving_away_at_a_hot_cock_a_guide_to/c119c7k)**", "ups": 760}, {"permalink": "http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/adee0/i_grew_up_in_a_cock_fighting_family_ama/", "short_link": "http://redd.it/adee0", "author": {}, "title": "I grew up in a cock fighting family.

It appears to be tradition at this house to sign the party table.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The host, John, was brilliant. He had planned an Easter egg hunt for this party. A clever thing to do when hosting parties is to give an activity that is distracting. It causes people to bond and get to know each other without even noticing. I took notes for the next time I might host a party.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The hunt was a team scavenger hunt with clues and instead of eggs, we were finding small bottles of vodka, which we were to drink if we found them. Two people per team.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;As John was explaining the rules, I caught the eyes of one of the girls standing opposite the table. I decided now would be a great opportunity to leave my mark on the party table.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;She was watching as I took the marker that was lying there, and I started analyzing some of the drawings. One of the tidbits was a drawing of a three inch penis and under it the words &amp;quot;This is John&amp;#39;s Penis (Actual Size).&amp;quot; I started to scribble down &amp;quot;that&amp;#39;s really not true at all.&amp;quot; and put an arrow pointing at the remark.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;After making the mark I looked up and acted like I didn&amp;#39;t know I was being watched. &amp;quot;Oh, hah, yeah, it&amp;#39;s really not that size at all.

I just found it very unpleasant and uncomfortable and thus, didn&amp;#39;t ever do it with her. She urged me to try, half begged and was even kind of hard on me about it - to the point of being angry at my lack of effort.  I thought this was unfair and wrong because I was uncomfortable with it - I even thought it was bordering on abusive because she was kind of  &amp;quot;forcing&amp;quot; me to go down on her. So I did it it for her every once and while, always forcing myself - and she always seemed to have an OK time.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Then one night, after a few drinks and a little ganja, something changed... I don&amp;#39;t know why but that night I ate her pussy like a ravenous dog.  She writhed and moaned, pulled my hair and pushed my face into her cunt.  I remember rolling over and fliping her onto my face. She instinctually started riding, thrusting my mouth and face - her whole body quivering in ecstasy. This was new to me - I&amp;#39;d never eaten pussy this passionately - but I loved it. When my face started looking like a glazed doughnut, I lifted her off me and put her on her back again.  This time, instead of acting like I hadn&amp;#39;t eaten in days, I started caressing her pussy with my finger tips, spreading the lips, licking and kissing here and there. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;A that moment, at 24 years of age, I finally fell in love with pussy.&lt;/strong&gt;  I said I loved pussy before, but really I was afraid of it.  Until that moment all I &lt;em&gt;really&lt;/em&gt; wanted to do was put my dick in it.  Now I love it.

I just found it very unpleasant and uncomfortable and thus, didn't ever do it with her. She urged me to try, half begged and was even kind of hard on me about it - to the point of being angry at my lack of effort.  I thought this was unfair and wrong because I was uncomfortable with it - I even thought it was bordering on abusive because she was kind of  \"forcing\" me to go down on her. So I did it it for her every once and while, always forcing myself - and she always seemed to have an OK time.\n\n&gt;Then one night, after a few drinks and a little ganja, something changed... I don't know why but that night I ate her pussy like a ravenous dog.  She writhed and moaned, pulled my hair and pushed my face into her cunt.  I remember rolling over and fliping her onto my face. She instinctually started riding, thrusting my mouth and face - her whole body quivering in ecstasy. This was new to me - I'd never eaten pussy this passionately - but I loved it. When my face started looking like a glazed doughnut, I lifted her off me and put her on her back again.  This time, instead of acting like I hadn't eaten in days, I started caressing her pussy with my finger tips, spreading the lips, licking and kissing here and there. \n\n&gt;**A that moment, at 24 years of age, I finally fell in love with pussy.**  I said I loved pussy before, but really I was afraid of it.  Until that moment all I *really* wanted to do was put my dick in it.  Now I love it.  I love the smell and taste and the experimenting it takes to find out what makes her go wild.  \n\n&gt;It's made sex immeasurably better. What was 20 minutes of intercourse has become hours of adventure.

Your headline should match the article's headline as closely as possible, to avoid misrepresenting the gist or facts of the article. Note, the \"no editorializing\" rule does not apply to self-posts. For those, standard guidelines of reddiquette apply.\n\n\u2022 Resort to racist/sexist insults, in submissions or comments. They add nothing to the discussion, and they will likely be removed. If you use repeated hate speech or abusive language you may get a temporary ban from the community. Repeated violators will be permanently banned.\n\n\u2022 Use link shorteners. Reddit usually assumes that they\u2019re spam, so they end up in the spam filter. If you have a comment or submission that you want to be seen immediately, don\u2019t use link shorteners. If you do, sign out and check that your submission/comment is visible. If it\u2019s not, message the moderators.\n\n\u2022 Post users' personal information.

Many times we have no idea why a link/comment has been reported, and it just takes up time that we could be using to actually read /Canada. Reports should be reserved for submissions/comments that don\u2019t meet the guidelines- spammers, hate speech, completely off-topic.\n\n-----------------------------------------------------\n\nThe moderators of r/Canada reserve the right to moderate posts and comments at their discretion, with regard to their perception of the suitability of said posts and comments for this subreddit.

The large majority of people here about who have adopted are adopting children from foreign countries because it&amp;#39;s basically just plain easier. Why not fix our adoption and foster care process in the US so that mothers who are worried about giving up their child can find a good home instead of contemplating abortion? Besides that, people are worried about killing a living being an yet we have kids being raised in awful conditions with no parents or in abusive homes.

Oh yeah and eating, and not like a pig either, just normal amounts of food.  So I&amp;#39;m contemplating why the fuck should I keep trying?  In some ways I am worse off now than when I started working.  For example, my body hurts now and it didn&amp;#39;t before.  The work I do is sometimes quite hard and I&amp;#39;ve been thinking that there is no way I can keep this shit up for 20 more years.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I have changed so much in the last 20 years, when I started working I was so full of energy and ready to go out and take on the world.  I was gonna make it big and have it all.  Then reality happened.  No I just don&amp;#39;t give a fuck anymore.  I can barely convince myself to work anymore.  I have seen so much greed and so many ass kissing people that I want to puke.  Nobody works because they want to or because they enjoy what they do,  fuck no.  I think maybe I&amp;#39;ve met 2 or 3 people in my entire lifetime that actually enjoyed what they did.  Would you still do what you do if there was no pay?  NO?  Then you are doing something that you do not enjoy, ie. working for money.  No wonder people go postal.

Oh yeah and eating, and not like a pig either, just normal amounts of food.  So I'm contemplating why the fuck should I keep trying?  In some ways I am worse off now than when I started working.  For example, my body hurts now and it didn't before.  The work I do is sometimes quite hard and I've been thinking that there is no way I can keep this shit up for 20 more years.\n\nI have changed so much in the last 20 years, when I started working I was so full of energy and ready to go out and take on the world.  I was gonna make it big and have it all.  Then reality happened.  No I just don't give a fuck anymore.  I can barely convince myself to work anymore.  I have seen so much greed and so many ass kissing people that I want to puke.  Nobody works because they want to or because they enjoy what they do,  fuck no.  I think maybe I've met 2 or 3 people in my entire lifetime that actually enjoyed what they did.  Would you still do what you do if there was no pay?  NO?  Then you are doing something that you do not enjoy, ie. working for money.  No wonder people go postal.

Huck as the unreliable narrator is a major device in the book. That language is a part of his lens. His transformation as he learns that everything his society has taught him (including the use of the n-word) is the point of the book. \n\nMaybe I'm wrong, it's been a long time since I've read it, but I was just wondering what everyone else thinks. \n\n\n**EDIT**: Someone asked what do we do now. I'm about to go to work, but when I get back I plan to look into what publisher is doing this and just research it a little more. Would anyone be interested in writing to the publisher or something along those lines? Does anyone have any ideas? I'll put them here.

GOOD JOB REDDIT!&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;", "text": "It's shit like this, Reddit.\n\nLast night, faggot_emo_kid promised to run naked through the mall yelling THE NORWALL BACONS AT MIDNIGHT if he received 1000 upvotes; I'm also pretty sure that there was something about curing cancer in there, but it's open to interpretation (a clever con). Here's the original thread:\n\nhttp://www.reddit.com/r/circlejerk/comments/lljmi/if_this_gets_1000_upvotes_i_will_cover_myself_in/\n\nThe Reddit hivemind of course jumped on the bandwagon, since faggot_emo_kid is a well-respected Redditor of 3 months with 50 link karma. Obviously, a lot of people thought they could simply trust an anonymous person on the Internet with their upvotes. Look, I'm not saying that every post promising to run naked covered in baby oil through a public place is fake, but USE SOME DISCRETION when sending people upvotes, please.\n\nDue to the success of some (legit) recent causes, a lot of people have been abusing Reddit's altruism by begging for upvotes, and we really should stop and ask ourselves whether or not their stories hold up. We can't simply donate upvotes to anybody who comes up with a plausible story like faggot_emo_kid's.\n\nNOW FOR THE PROOF.\n\nA simple search through faggot_emo_kid's comment history causes his seemingly believable story to unravel.\n\n1. faggot_emo_kid has a history of begging for upvotes ([here](http://www.reddit.com/r/circlejerk/comments/kn4xe/dae_experience_basic_human_emotions/c2lq5mc), [here](http://www.reddit.com/r/circlejerk/comments/le73i/its_simple_we_downvote_the_batman/c2rz82r))\n\n2. He claims to have a [stammering problem](http://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/kxhw9/what_is_one_thing_you_suffer_from_that_other/c2o1vcy?context=3). Why would somebody suffering from a speech disorder caused by anxiety need to run naked through a mall? WHY?\n\n3. [Here](http://www.reddit.com/r/ForeverAlone/comments/kqd0p/as_i_woke_up_today_i_thought_to_myself_fuck_i/c2mhxql) he cites his preference for staying indoors; hardly a likely candidate for baby-oiled public nudity.\n\n4. His extensive [knowledge of Runescape](http://www.reddit.com/r/runescape/comments/kpzqp/selling_mystic_hat_1m/c2m9zez) suggests that he has little experience with either nudity or public places like malls.\n\n5. [Here](http://www.reddit.com/r/acne/comments/kjcnn/should_i_just_continue_using_this_till_i_grow_out/c2krobc?context=3) he admits to having an acne problem. Surely he wouldn't consider covering his epidermis with oil, exacerbating it? (also, [here](http://www.reddit.com/r/amiugly/comments/jwau5/so_what_i_am_like_people_18_male/c2fnxv0?context=3))\n\n6. Finally, **the webwork of lies about his/her identity**. faggot_emo_kid claims to be [gay](http://www.reddit.com/r/circlejerk/comments/kn4xe/dae_experience_basic_human_emotions/c2lq5mc?context=3) and a [chick](http://www.reddit.com/r/circlejerk/comments/k41cm/if_elected_i_will_make_hot_girls_have_sex_with/c2hgjvr?context=3) (also using this to ask for upvotes), but here s/he [claims to get lots of dick](http://www.reddit.com/r/pics/comments/jtu08/muslim_punk/c2f2rgo). Well, which is it????\n\nBased upon these inconsistencellencies alone, **it should be clear to anybody that faggot_emo_kid's story cannot be trusted. If you send him/her(?) your upvotes, you're throwing them away.**\n\nBut that's not all. Here's the most damning evidence that faggot_emo_kid is actually *part of a sockpuppet network of Nigerian scam artists who defraud people of upvotes with seemingly plausible stories*.\n\nCheck out user [GIVEMEFUCKINGUPVOTES](http://www.reddit.com/user/GIVEMEFUCKINGUPVOTES), obviously a throwaway of faggot_emo_kid's used to whip up a tornado of ponzi-style upvote theft.\n\n[In this thread](http://www.reddit.com/r/circlejerk/comments/l1zwx/check_out_my_witty_and_clever_novelty_account_im/) faggot_emo_kid throws spurious accusations against GIVEMEFUCKINGUPVOTES, in a thinly-veiled attempt to muster up sympathy for the latter. What happened? GIVEMEFUCKINGUPVOTES walked away with as many as 933 upvotes, **[later claiming that he made his (sockpuppet) account simply for the money](http://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/l74vn/what_is_the_worst_thing_youve_ever_done_for_money/c2qfudd)**.\n\n*If this information has not already convinced you, then this phrase in italics*, **this clause in bold**, ***THEN BOLD ITALICS***, completed with a ~~stupid~~ clever use of strikethrough, surely should.\n\nNow faggot_emo_kid is set to walk away with over 1000 more upvotes with his phony story.

If you are using triggering language in an educational or demonstrative capacity, we ask that you please wrap it in a trigger warning, e.g. `[problematic language](/trigger)`. Alternatively, if you are submitting a post that contains hateful remarks or triggering language, please append a [TW] to your post title, e.g. [TW] Title of Post\n\n* **Rule 2:** Demonstrate a willingness to learn. This is a **[safe space](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Safe-space)**. Anyone can make a mistake and accidentally say something hurtful or triggering. If you find yourself corrected for making this error, please try to learn from it.

They will still be accessible from outside links.  Deleted threads may be unmoderated, so keep this in mind.

He came into our relationship shortly after his first marriage crumbled apart, his wife having cheated and been forgiven via marriage counseling twice before finally leaving him and marrying the last of her string of boyfriends.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I came into the relationship at the end of my rockin\u2019 single 20s, having always been free or boyfriended, and having always lived alone and happily independent. My husband\u2019s first marriage began when he was still in college, and he only had two sexual partners before his wife \u2013 whereas my number of partners is well into the double digits.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;So my husband has apparently never been with a woman who acted on her own sexual feelings before. His wife acted like she hated sex because of a traumatic adolescence, but then acted out her sexuality behind his back, and his earlier partners were inexperienced early-college-aged girls.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;In the beginning of our relationship, back in the days when I thought the sex was \u201cgood,\u201d we always ended up in an argument after it was over. I was accustomed to doing whatever felt right \u2013 different positions, rough sometimes, oral, touching myself in order to finish if he wasn\u2019t able to make me orgasm, etc. Pretty tame stuff, actually. It never occurred to me that this might make him uncomfortable, as he was obviously enjoying it, but it slowly became obvious from the talks we would have afterward that something wasn\u2019t sitting right with him.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;He would need constant reassurance from me after sex that I hadn\u2019t been molested as a child, or hadn\u2019t been overtly promiscuous, that I was SURE there was nothing wrong with me and I was SURE I didn\u2019t want to be with other guys. He was &lt;a href=\"http://finallyfeminism101.wordpress.com/2010/04/04/what-is-slut-shaming/\"&gt;slut-shaming&lt;/a&gt; me, though he wasn\u2019t doing it deliberately and I\u2019m sure he\u2019d be horrified if he knew that\u2019s how I saw it. As the arguments became more frequent, I became more angry and uncomfortable, and now we rarely have sex at all.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I don\u2019t know how to enjoy sex anymore because I don\u2019t know what is appropriate in his mind for a girl to do or not do in bed. And I minored in women\u2019s studies so I am hyper-aware of how icky and oppressive this double standard is, which makes me absolutely cringe when he comes near me. He swears he\u2019s \u201cover it now,\u201d that it just had to do with his first marriage ending in infidelity, and he wishes like hell I would go back to being his super-sexy girl. But I\u2019m afraid it\u2019s too late. I don\u2019t initiate and I\u2019m scared I never will again. Here are the reasons I can\u2019t imagine initiating sex with him:&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;ul&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Raging discomfort. No idea what is or is not permitted for me in his narrow idea of female sexuality.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Loss of respect for him. I know he still wants sex because he complains about the lack of it a lot, but mostly he just passively remarks that he needs \u201cthings\u201d and I\u2019m clearly expected to take the lead. When I don\u2019t, because of the discomfort, he will approach me on occasion, whereupon I freeze and have to repeat over and over to myself to relax, and eventually we do it and it\u2019s fine, but I\u2019m just getting it over with and he has to know that. We used to have real sex, that we both enjoyed, and now we don\u2019t and he\u2019s just fine with it?! Eww.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Loss of attraction to him. Related to the point above, but goes further. He gets turned on too easily. I learned early on that flirting and kissing is not fun to him unless we\u2019re going to go all the way, which is hard because we have kids now. He can\u2019t even handle a footrub, or me stretching my back in front of him, without getting sexually frustrated. It\u2019s creepy as hell. And he\u2019s a minute man. He can\u2019t rub me or play with me too much because he\u2019ll come, and when we do have sex he comes within 10-20 strokes no matter how slow and boring he\u2019s going.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ul&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I don&amp;#39;t know how to fix this. We&amp;#39;ve had conversations about it from time to time, but they don&amp;#39;t seem to help, probably because I&amp;#39;m so afraid of hurting his feelings and making this even more awkward. Any advice would be helpful.

WE\u2013&lt;strong&gt;WE.&lt;/strong&gt; As you read on, you\u2019ll see just how many people came together in a selfless effort to make your Valentine\u2019s Day less shitty.

Simple enough. Request one in the comments section. To establish damage control on potential scammers, we would like for you to &lt;strong&gt;post a pic of yourself with a sign reading \u201cRAOP, will you be my Valentine?\u201d&lt;/strong&gt; Also be sure to include your name, date, weight, height, professor\u2019s name, course number\u2014whatever. Get creative; it\u2019s encouraged here at RAoP after all. Take a pic of yourself all dressed up, ladies can do an undressed version, do something funny, or take one with your cat (don\u2019t lie, we know you have one). This is &lt;em&gt;not&lt;/em&gt; a joke or a gimmick, nor are we poking fun at your single status. We just want to see the smiling faces of all the peeps getting pizza.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;One of the fine people mentioned above will contact your (either via comment reply or PM) and request your info so they can give you that pizza we\u2019ve been talking about. If one or more givers responds to you, please calm the fuck down. This does not mean you get two pizzas. The two givers fighting over you will settle who\u2019s gets to do the giving in a civil and cordial manner\u2014either a rock, paper, scissors match via messages (best of three), or a duel on the following morning (one pistol, one bullet, ten paces). To avoid the previously mentioned conflicts. &lt;strong&gt;Givers: if you have already gifted a pizza, please be sure to highlight this in the comments section under said requestor (i.e., pizzad, gave it to this guy, suck it hunger, whatever), so we know they have already received.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Protip:&lt;/strong&gt; If you can decide on the pizza chain you want, know your email address, and have the verification code (see sidebar) ready ahead of time, your giver can get you your pizza faster. After all this is sorted out, you\u2019ll receive your $10 gift card. Like Pasta, I also work and go to school, so I\u2019m actually forgoing sleep at the moment just to try and give a few out before I go to work. Also, we\u2019re employing the 24-hour account rule for this giveaway to further deter scammers.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Couples&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;We haven\u2019t forgotten about you; don\u2019t worry, we want to show you some love too. Since there\u2019s two of you (and if my math is correct), couples get $20 cards. For couples, you will also need to post a pic holding the aforementioned sign, &lt;em&gt;however&lt;/em&gt;, since I don\u2019t want the single people trying to get $20 cards by taking pictures with their mom, sister, cousin, uncle, etc., &lt;strong&gt;your  picture must include you and your significant other showing each other &lt;em&gt;physical&lt;/em&gt; (operative word here) affection&lt;/strong&gt;. Kissing, groping, banging (probably won\u2019t be allowed by the mods, but you can still send them my way if you want\u2026&lt;em&gt;rubs hands together deviously&lt;/em&gt;), whatever\u2014just show us that you\u2019re into each other. Same process, someone contacts you, you send them info, you get pizza. Givers: wash, rinse, repeat.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;As one who is familiar with mass giveaways, I know there will be people clamoring for pizzas like a heard of zombies hungering for human flesh. Not too long ago, I attempted (rather stupidly, I might add) to conduct one on my own. Needless to say, I was overwhelmed in a matter minutes, receiving no less than a dozen messages every other minute. But now, I have an army of dedicated RAoPers at my back. More people will get pizza, more bellies will be filled. And if I told you the combined monetary pool we\u2019ve put together for this event, you\u2019d shit your pants, clean yourself up, change pants, then shit yourself again. There may be many of you seeking pizza, but we are dedicated, resilient, and mere overwhelming numbers won\u2019t stop us.  You will break upon this post as water on rock. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;As King Th\u00e9oden, son of Thengel, said: &lt;em&gt;\u201cLet them come.\u201d&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Also, we checked the fridge and pantry, and we\u2019re fresh out of fucks\u2014we\u2019re giving out pizza, bitches.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;TL;DR:&lt;/strong&gt; Start at the top.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Special thanks&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I would first like to take the time to thank all you givers (27!) who took time out of your day and money out of your pockets to help with this cause. Each and every one of you are more generous than most of the people I\u2019ve come across in real life.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;My deepest thanks and gratitude to &lt;a href=\"http://www.reddit.com/user/RobSpewack\"&gt;RobSpewack&lt;/a&gt; for coming up with the whole Valentine\u2019s Day giveaway idea. If anyone who gets a pizza today feels compelled to pay it forward in the future, give it to this guy\u2014he deserves it. He was the one who originally pitched the brilliant idea when I was mentally toying around with planning a collaborative giveaway a couple months back. If he hadn\u2019t done so, I would\u2019ve ended up haphazardly hosting this event on some meaningless day. Seriously, Rob, I can\u2019t thank you enough.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I would also like to thank &lt;a href=\"http://www.reddit.com/user/DownSouthDread\"&gt;DownSouthDread&lt;/a&gt; who helped me with the promotional aspects, details, expanding the team, and host of other factors I probably would\u2019ve overlooked had he not brought them to my attention. He really helped nail down the whole \u201chow\u201d aspect to this endeavor and I really don\u2019t know how I would\u2019ve figured this thing out without him.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=\"http://www.reddit.com/user/Glinda_Da_Good_Witch\"&gt;Glinda_Da_Good_Witch&lt;/a&gt;. Glinda, oh Glinda, where do I even begin. When I first contacted her she asked how many people I had signed up. I told her, and she replied that she had a few contacts she would try getting on board. Not even thirty minutes later, she messaged me with a list of givers to add to the list. Then more the following day. This woman can round up people like sheep. However she does it, I can only imagine that there\u2019s a fair amount of magic involved.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Last but not least, let\u2019s give it up for our fearless mods, &lt;a href=\"http://www.reddit.com/user/Gadianton\"&gt;Gadianton&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"http://www.reddit.com/user/snang\"&gt;snang&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"http://www.reddit.com/user/Cayuscokid\"&gt;Cayuscokid&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"http://www.reddit.com/user/Rollout\"&gt;Rollout&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"http://www.reddit.com/user/moshimoochi\"&gt;moshimoochi&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"http://www.reddit.com/user/PastafarianTwit\"&gt;PastafarianTwit&lt;/a&gt;, who were gracious enough to lend their hands to this cause.

Unfortunately for the single population out there, this is the one day hand-crafted by fate\u2019s ugly hands to simply remind them of their single status, and once again pierce their hearts with that infernal sword of loneliness. It sucks, I know \u2013 I\u2019ve been there. Being single on Valentine\u2019s Day is akin to spending Christmas or New Year\u2019s alone; not fun. But don\u2019t worry, my lonely friends. RAoP is here to help you. This Valentine\u2019s Day won\u2019t suck, at least, not *as* much.\n\nTo put it simply, this is a Valentine\u2019s Day giveaway\u2014one of colossal proportions. In fact, it\u2019s so big, we had to stretch it out over the entire day. Ah, \u201cwe?\u201d you might ask? Yes. WE\u2013**WE.** As you read on, you\u2019ll see just how many people came together in a selfless effort to make your Valentine\u2019s Day less shitty. Before you continue on to the part where you read the guidelines (which, so help me, you *will* read) on how to acquire your pizza, please take the time to recognize this all-star squad of RAoPers who are taking the time to serve you.\n\nThe roster, in no particular order:\n\n[PastafarianTwit](http://www.reddit.com/user/PastafarianTwit), [DownSouthDread](http://www.reddit.com/user/DownSouthDread), [RobSpewack](http://www.reddit.com/user/RobSpewack), [Glinda_Da_Good_Witch](http://www.reddit.com/user/Glinda_Da_Good_Witch), [jetboyterp](http://www.reddit.com/user/jetboyterp), [badbrownie](http://www.reddit.com/user/badbrownie), [chupanibre25](http://www.reddit.com/user/chupanibre25), [toncinap](http://www.reddit.com/user/toncinap), [overripebanana](http://www.reddit.com/user/overripebanana), [Gadianton](http://www.reddit.com/user/Gadianton), [moshimoochi](http://www.reddit.com/user/moshimoochi), [tanyagal2](http://www.reddit.com/user/tanyagal2), [CheeseGamer](http://www.reddit.com/user/CheeseGamer), [snang](http://www.reddit.com/user/snang), [Cayuscokid](http://www.reddit.com/user/Cayuscokid), [fordandt]( http://www.reddit.com/user/fordandt), [m2mu](http://www.reddit.com/user/m2mu), [kencater](http://www.reddit.com/user/kencater), [MonkeyHouse](http://www.reddit.com/user/MonkeyHouse), [Cacoo](http://www.reddit.com/user/Cacoo), [awana56](http://www.reddit.com/user/awana56), [aghos](http://www.reddit.com/user/aghos), [Madamrimbaud](http://www.reddit.com/user/Madamrimbaud), [Supersized](http://www.reddit.com/user/Supersized), [Coasttocoaster](http://www.reddit.com/user/Coasttocoaster), [TokenFemale](http://www.reddit.com/user/TokenFemale), [Drolsonator](http://www.reddit.com/user/Drolsonator)\n\n(Givers, *please* tell me if I missed your name.)\n\n**Guidelines**\n\nSo, you want a pizza, yes? Simple enough. Request one in the comments section. To establish damage control on potential scammers, we would like for you to **post a pic of yourself with a sign reading \u201cRAOP, will you be my Valentine?\u201d** Also be sure to include your name, date, weight, height, professor\u2019s name, course number\u2014whatever. Get creative; it\u2019s encouraged here at RAoP after all. Take a pic of yourself all dressed up, ladies can do an undressed version, do something funny, or take one with your cat (don\u2019t lie, we know you have one). This is *not* a joke or a gimmick, nor are we poking fun at your single status. We just want to see the smiling faces of all the peeps getting pizza.\n\nOne of the fine people mentioned above will contact your (either via comment reply or PM) and request your info so they can give you that pizza we\u2019ve been talking about. If one or more givers responds to you, please calm the fuck down. This does not mean you get two pizzas. The two givers fighting over you will settle who\u2019s gets to do the giving in a civil and cordial manner\u2014either a rock, paper, scissors match via messages (best of three), or a duel on the following morning (one pistol, one bullet, ten paces). To avoid the previously mentioned conflicts. **Givers: if you have already gifted a pizza, please be sure to highlight this in the comments section under said requestor (i.e., pizzad, gave it to this guy, suck it hunger, whatever), so we know they have already received.**\n\n**Protip:** If you can decide on the pizza chain you want, know your email address, and have the verification code (see sidebar) ready ahead of time, your giver can get you your pizza faster. After all this is sorted out, you\u2019ll receive your $10 gift card. Like Pasta, I also work and go to school, so I\u2019m actually forgoing sleep at the moment just to try and give a few out before I go to work. Also, we\u2019re employing the 24-hour account rule for this giveaway to further deter scammers.\n\n **Couples**\n\nWe haven\u2019t forgotten about you; don\u2019t worry, we want to show you some love too. Since there\u2019s two of you (and if my math is correct), couples get $20 cards. For couples, you will also need to post a pic holding the aforementioned sign, *however*, since I don\u2019t want the single people trying to get $20 cards by taking pictures with their mom, sister, cousin, uncle, etc., **your  picture must include you and your significant other showing each other *physical* (operative word here) affection**. Kissing, groping, banging (probably won\u2019t be allowed by the mods, but you can still send them my way if you want\u2026*rubs hands together deviously*), whatever\u2014just show us that you\u2019re into each other. Same process, someone contacts you, you send them info, you get pizza. Givers: wash, rinse, repeat.\n\nAs one who is familiar with mass giveaways, I know there will be people clamoring for pizzas like a heard of zombies hungering for human flesh. Not too long ago, I attempted (rather stupidly, I might add) to conduct one on my own. Needless to say, I was overwhelmed in a matter minutes, receiving no less than a dozen messages every other minute. But now, I have an army of dedicated RAoPers at my back. More people will get pizza, more bellies will be filled. And if I told you the combined monetary pool we\u2019ve put together for this event, you\u2019d shit your pants, clean yourself up, change pants, then shit yourself again. There may be many of you seeking pizza, but we are dedicated, resilient, and mere overwhelming numbers won\u2019t stop us.  You will break upon this post as water on rock. \n\nAs King Th\u00e9oden, son of Thengel, said: *\u201cLet them come.\u201d*\n\nAlso, we checked the fridge and pantry, and we\u2019re fresh out of fucks\u2014we\u2019re giving out pizza, bitches.\n\n**TL;DR:** Start at the top.\n\n**Special thanks**\n\nI would first like to take the time to thank all you givers (27!) who took time out of your day and money out of your pockets to help with this cause. Each and every one of you are more generous than most of the people I\u2019ve come across in real life.\n\nMy deepest thanks and gratitude to [RobSpewack](http://www.reddit.com/user/RobSpewack) for coming up with the whole Valentine\u2019s Day giveaway idea. If anyone who gets a pizza today feels compelled to pay it forward in the future, give it to this guy\u2014he deserves it. He was the one who originally pitched the brilliant idea when I was mentally toying around with planning a collaborative giveaway a couple months back. If he hadn\u2019t done so, I would\u2019ve ended up haphazardly hosting this event on some meaningless day. Seriously, Rob, I can\u2019t thank you enough.\n\nI would also like to thank [DownSouthDread](http://www.reddit.com/user/DownSouthDread) who helped me with the promotional aspects, details, expanding the team, and host of other factors I probably would\u2019ve overlooked had he not brought them to my attention. He really helped nail down the whole \u201chow\u201d aspect to this endeavor and I really don\u2019t know how I would\u2019ve figured this thing out without him.\n\n[Glinda_Da_Good_Witch](http://www.reddit.com/user/Glinda_Da_Good_Witch). Glinda, oh Glinda, where do I even begin. When I first contacted her she asked how many people I had signed up. I told her, and she replied that she had a few contacts she would try getting on board. Not even thirty minutes later, she messaged me with a list of givers to add to the list. Then more the following day. This woman can round up people like sheep. However she does it, I can only imagine that there\u2019s a fair amount of magic involved.\n\nLast but not least, let\u2019s give it up for our fearless mods, [Gadianton](http://www.reddit.com/user/Gadianton), [snang](http://www.reddit.com/user/snang), [Cayuscokid](http://www.reddit.com/user/Cayuscokid), [Rollout]( http://www.reddit.com/user/Rollout), [moshimoochi](http://www.reddit.com/user/moshimoochi), and [PastafarianTwit](http://www.reddit.com/user/PastafarianTwit), who were gracious enough to lend their hands to this cause. Pasta also deserves our thanks for his efforts in promoting this event and coordinating with mods from other subreddits to get the word out.\n\n**TL;DR2:** No, you have to read this one too.\n\nEdit: Props to snang for putting up the sweet layout.\n\nEdit2: Work now, might try to squeeze one in at lunch. People I'm still waiting on to hear back on, I'll check in from time to time. Other givers, have at it.\n\nEdit3: Just checking in on break, looking good so far. Keep up the good work givers. Also, all you foreveralone folks, after browsing all of your pics, how the hell are *any* of you single? You're all gorgeous!\n\nEdit4: Quick check in on break. Good news for requestors, to be honest, I don't even think we've given away half of what we pooled together. Foreveralone crowd, you should take advantage of this opportunity and browse the other singles, there are some lookers out there.

And I think (hope!) we all accept that. I just hate the way all of my favorite pro-choice bloggers and online peeps are talking about this subject. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I am the product of rape. Though my mom is pretty conservative on a lot of issues, she&amp;#39;s incredibly pro-choice. She has even had an abortion in the past, and while she wishes the circumstances were different, she firmly believes it was the right decision--and that everyone has a right to decide whether or not they should carry a pregnancy to term. I am incredibly liberal on most issues and I completely agree with her. My circumstances affirm my pro-choice beliefs. I&amp;#39;m obviously glad my mom didn&amp;#39;t abort me but I think that my mom&amp;#39;s decision to keep me wasn&amp;#39;t actually all that smart at the time--her family abandoned her and we were incredibly impoverished, barely able to get by for many years.

When people start talking about &amp;quot;rape babies,&amp;quot; I feel like my life is worth less than the rest of you because of the circumstances surrounding my birth. I feel like the conversation usually goes like this: &amp;quot;Oh, well this woman was raped, obviously that useless fetus just needs to be jettisoned ASAP before it grows up to become a violent criminal or a huge whore, &lt;em&gt;statistics say&lt;/em&gt;.&amp;quot; You know? Growing up without a father is tough enough because everybody puts these expectations about how broken you are on you. But growing up as the product of rape makes you feel like your life is an endless reel of &amp;quot;I Shouldn&amp;#39;t Be Alive.&amp;quot; I know that &amp;quot;rape baby&amp;quot; is much easier to say than &amp;quot;product of rape&amp;quot; but there are a lot of other epithets that are shorter than the politer versions of the same term.

I appreciate hearing from you and the opportunity to respond.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Senate amendment 2588 to H.R.3326, Department of Defense Appropriations Act for 2010, was introduced by Senator Al Franken in response to the case of Jamie Leigh Jones, a 22-year-old Texan who alleges that in 2005 she was drugged and gang raped by fellow contract workers while working for defense contractor Halliburton/KBR at Camp Hope in Baghdad.  Ms. Jones sued Halliburton/KBR and a three-judge panel of the 5th Circuit U.S. Court of Appeals ruled in September 2009 that Jones&amp;#39; employment contract with Halliburton/KBR does not prohibit her from suing over the claims she has made and that her lawsuit against Halliburton/KBR can go to trial.  I am glad Ms. Jones is getting her day in court for these civil claims against the company, and I believe that if the charges bear out, those responsible for this horrific crime should be prosecuted to the fullest extent of the law.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I voted against this amendment in accordance with the recommendation of the President and his Department of Defense, which opposed this amendment. Under the Franken amendment, defense contractors who receive federal funding could no longer require that employees sign contracts mandating that they settle employment disputes through arbitration. The amendment applies to current defense contracts and thus contractors who have employment arbitration agreements with their employees and who have already completed work for the military would not be able to paid for that work, under the Franken amendment.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;In addition, I believe that this amendment would reverberate far beyond Ms. Jones&amp;#39; claim against Halliburton because it would lead to defense contractors eliminating arbitration altogether as an option for employees. Arbitration is a proven process that offers fast and fair resolutions of employment disputes, and its must be preserved as an option.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Without arbitration, employees are left with only the option of going to court, which is a very expensive and lengthy process.  Arbitration allows employees to still make their claim and pay nothing or nearly nothing to do so because an employee does not have to hire an attorney for arbitration.  Additionally, statistics show that employees actually fair better in the arbitration process than they do in court.  According to a survey, employees have a 63 percent chance of prevailing in arbitration versus a 43 percent chance of prevailing in court.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The Franken amendment ultimately passed by a vote of 68 to 30, and some are characterizing the 30 senators who voted against the Franken amendment as &amp;quot;Pro-Rape&amp;quot; or &amp;quot;Pro-Gang Rape.&amp;quot; This is politics at its worst. I am a husband, a father of a daughter, and a grandfather to three granddaughters, and it is absolutely ludicrous to characterize me or my colleagues as &amp;quot;pro-rape.&amp;quot;  Rape is a heinous crime and those who commit sexual assault should be punished, and I believe that the U.S. Justice Department should become more aggressive in prosecuting cases of rape and violent crime in combat zones such as Iraq.

Before I knew it, she lifted up my penis to go under my shaft to put the lube there. Bad idea. My penis was in the trajectory of her face, and not long after I EXPLODED. My semen hit her mostly on the shoulder, but some of it got on her chin. She just looked at me with a blank face.

When I was finally able to get up, I proceeded with \nY day as he laughed the whole afternoon. \n\nFast forward to that night at home.... I go to take a shower, look at my testicles and my left one is the size of a baseball. I kid you not. \n\nI rush to the hospital, and it turns out i have a testicular contortion. This is where the most embarrassing moment of my LIFE will occur....\n\nI get there and after a few test, they decide to give me an ultra sound. I'm in the empty room with just a robe on. In comes a BEAUTIFUL asian nurse. I didn't know exactly what an ultra sound consisted of but I found out really quick. She comes in with the ultra sound lube, or whatever they call it. (If you've never had one, this lube is warm.) She pours it on my testicles and proceeds for the next 2 minutes to maneuver her hands around my genitalia. I stayed calm for all but 10 seconds after it started. Then I realized that my penis was getting erect so I started to panic. I tried not thinking about it and had my eyes closed. Before I knew it, she lifted up my penis to go under my shaft to put the lube there. Bad idea. My penis was in the trajectory of her face, and not long after I EXPLODED. My semen hit her mostly on the shoulder, but some of it got on her chin. She just looked at me with a blank face. (Remember: I was 13, and had never had semen come out of me, so the load was large.)\n\nI literally got up, left my clothes there, grabbed my dad and ran butt naked with just the gown to my car. Me and my dad have never spoken about it again. \n\nTL;DR - Punched in groin. Went to hospital. Had ultra sound by hot nurse. Got too excited, and exploded semen on her :(\n\nEdit: Grammar and NSFW tag.

It was not my idea to create this subreddit... A member, &amp;quot;Hime_Takamura&amp;quot; decided to go ahead and make one and made me a mod unannounced.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/blockquote&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I was under the impression that he was trying to split a piece of &lt;a href=\"/r/gore\"&gt;/r/gore&lt;/a&gt; off and send them to another subreddit he&amp;#39;s a mod of to give them more numbers, which probably isn&amp;#39;t the case.

A member, \"Hime_Takamura\" decided to go ahead and make one and made me a mod unannounced.\n\nI was under the impression that he was trying to split a piece of /r/gore off and send them to another subreddit he's a mod of to give them more numbers, which probably isn't the case. So I could be wrong for judging him so harshly for that. \n\nLastly, as for violentacrez since some of you seem to be upset, he left voluntarily and under good terms. He just doesn't want to be around animal gore, and that's 100% okay.\n \n**Edit 2:** I've decided to require tags for animal content so that those who don't wish to see it will have no excuses for clicking it. Those who like animal gore can keep it, and those who don't like it can easily avoid it. Everyone wins?  \n\n", "ups": 130}, {"permalink": "http://www.reddit.com/r/Gore/comments/onu54/so_ive_come_to_the_end_of_rgore_and_i_have_a_few/", "short_link": "http://redd.it/onu54", "author": {"has_mail": null, "name": "moonshine_fox", "created": 1323816033.0, "created_utc": 1323816033.0, "link_karma": 1697, "comment_karma": 392, "is_gold": false, "is_mod": false, "id": "6fmj8", "has_mod_mail": null}, "title": "So I've come to the end of r/gore and I have a few curious questions...", "num_comments": 205, "downs": 12, "created": 1327008388.0, "created_utc": 1327008388.0, "subreddit": {"display_name": "Gore", "description": "---\n\nWelcome to the dark side of reddit, where redditors meet reality. \n\n\n***Please title your posts clearly so people know what they're clicking.***\n\n---\n\nOther subreddits you may enjoy:\n\n* [PicsOfDeadKids](/r/picsofdeadkids) (self-explanatory)\n\n* [Guro](/r/guro) (animated gore)\n\n* [Shatter](/r/shatter) (non-fatal injuries) \n\n* [ScaredShitless](/r/scaredshitless) (a horror community)\n\n---\n\nSome other sites you may enjoy:\n\n* [GoreGrish](http://goregrish.com/)\n\n* [TheYNC](http://theync.com/index.php) \n\n* [Humoron](http://www.humoron.com/)\n\n* [MachoVideo](http://www.machovideo.com/)\n\n* [Heavy-R](http://www.heavy-r.com/)\n\n* [ShooshTime](http://www.shooshtime.com/)\n\n* [MentalZero](http://m.mentalzero.com/)\n\n* [NickleBack](http://www.nickelback.com/)\n\n* [HQFights](http://www.hqfights.com/)\n\n* [Ogrish.TV](http://www.ogrish.tv/)\n\n* [LiveLeak](http://www.liveleak.com/)\n\n* [BestGore](http://www.bestgore.com/)\n\n* [Hell.TV](http://www.hell.tv/)\n\n* [Kaotic](http://www.kaotic.com/)\n\n* [FunnyVideos](http://www.funny-videos.co.uk/)\n\n* [VIDFights](http://www.vidfights.com/)\n\n* [Rotten.com](http://www.rotten.com/)\n\n* [M90](http://m90.org/)\n\n* [Death and Dementia](http://www.deathndementia.com/)\n\n* [Blogrish](http://www.blogrish.net)\n\n* [Charon Boat](http://www.charonboat.com/)\n\n**TIP:** [How to access YNC underground videos](http://www.reddit.com/r/Gore/comments/qjko1/how_to_access_ync_underground_videos_guide/)", "name": "t5_2qpka", "created": 1228692015.0, "url": "/r/Gore/", "title": "Gore", "created_utc": 1228692015.0, "header_size": [195, 80], "over18": true, "subscribers": 5306, "header_title": null, "id": "2qpka", "header_img": "http://a.thumbs.redditmedia.com/MUcuPPQF_Jlmat8N.png"}, "score": 50, "over_18": true, "text_html": "&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;I am a nice, girlie girl, I like cats and rage comics and funny gifs.

Only regret that I'm now burdened with this fun, sexy secret life and can't share the bondage modeling experience with anyone...except Reddit.\n\nComplicating things: my wonderful fiance has no idea and I have no idea if and how I'll ever tell him. It was before we met, so I just never brought it up. \n\nI posted one photo in the thread, but that's all I will post.

I&amp;#39;m careful not to let her go as I tape a wrist to\neach armrest as I&amp;#39;m sitting in the chair.

ALWAYS a good lead into sexy time (albeit protected sexy time) \n", "ups": 200}, {"permalink": "http://www.reddit.com/r/sex/comments/m62rg/why_is_all_interracial_porn_so_horrible_racist/", "short_link": "http://redd.it/m62rg", "author": {"has_mail": null, "name": "dateymcgee", "created": 1281999262.0, "created_utc": 1281999262.0, "link_karma": 1, "comment_karma": 40, "is_gold": false, "is_mod": false, "id": "49azx", "has_mod_mail": null}, "title": "Why is all interracial porn so horrible racist?", "num_comments": 145, "downs": 117, "created": 1320847314.0, "created_utc": 1320847314.0, "subreddit": {"display_name": "sex", "description": "**r/sex is for civil discussions about all facets of sexuality and sexual relationships.** \n\n***\n[](http://webchat.freenode.net/?nick=Reddit...&amp;channels=reddit-sex&amp;uio=d4 \"Official r/sex IRC Channel.

A summary wouldn\u2019t allow me to truly show what I went through so I decided to spell it out.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;My childhood&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I was an accident. Both my parent made that pretty clear in my mind, for almost all of my childhood and teenage years. My father was 53 when I was born and my mother 38. They had been unhappily married for 20 years and one night, my father forced himself on my mother years after she had stopped taking the pill and 9 months later, I arrived.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I grew up miserable. My father was an alcoholic. He worked as a carpenter and worked long hours outside of the house. As soon as he came home, he would start drinking and later in the evening, beat my mother for an offense or another he thinks she did to him. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;My mother on the other hand is I guess a co-alcoholic and somehow thinks that our life was normal, that every husband in the world is like my father and every wife is like her. You know women who try to pretend that their husband loves them even if he beats her? My mom\u2019s rationalization isn\u2019t that he still loved her but rather than love simply doesn\u2019t exist. She was always a stay at home mom and if she left, not only would should she be alone in life but she would have no money. Needless to say, neither have any real education.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Both pretty much ignored me all my life. If my mother was hungry, she would prepare a meal for lunch when I came back from school, otherwise, I learned to fix myself a sandwich quite early. Only supper was guaranteed to be on the table because my father ate with us.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I couldn\u2019t receive any friends, because of my father and I couldn\u2019t visit any friends, because of their father who were just as bad as mine in my mother\u2019s mind.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;So I grew up limited only to meeting kids in school which sucks because real friends see each other outside of school.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I sucked in pretty much every subject. Not getting any help on homework and my inability to sleep until late at night because of my parent\u2019s arguing didn&amp;#39;t help. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But the worse was that nothing rang a bell in my mind. It was all normal. It was life. Movies and TV showed fiction including when it involved happy families.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I began lying to friends about my family but I couldn\u2019t realize that they were actually telling the truth. I couldn\u2019t conceive of parents who actually loved their kids. That was on TV, with monsters and fairy tales.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Teenager years&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Around 11 or 12, I began drinking. My father left bottles everywhere and I would take a few sips to help me calm down during the fights. I spent my evenings locked up in my room and drinking so I would try to ignore what was going on outside of my room. Like I said, I was mostly ignored. I was like a dog you had to feed. You could fight in front of it, because it couldn\u2019t understand you.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;At 12 however, you aren\u2019t a little girl anymore. Guys started to notice me. I was usually wearing awkward clothes and no one bothered to buy me a well-fitting bra. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I was desperate for attention and certain boys quickly discovered it. I lost my virginity at 13 to a guy who was a year or two older. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Drugs&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Soon, I was offered light drugs like marijuana, acid blotters and ecstasy. I didn\u2019t need more to get in the sack with a guy so I guess that\u2019s why I never tried cocaine or anything stronger.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Drugs helped me avoid my problems and allowed me to fly through the days either without feeling anything at all or by letting me feel things that had nothing to do with my daily life.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But more importantly, I don\u2019t think I ever took any drugs alone. I would take them with boys who offered it to me in exchange for sex and they all thought that it was the drug I was after when I think I wanted some love and affection. The drugs were just a nice bonus.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Most of the time however, I felt depressed and a few time took a lot of pills to apparently kill myself, but in reality, I think I mostly wanted to know if people would miss me when I was gone. I don\u2019t really want to talk about that, not even with my boyfriend in private.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Death of my father&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;When I turned 16, my dad died of rectal cancer gone general. He didn\u2019t even realize he was sick until a few months before his death. I had known he had problems on the toilet for years but we never thought it was something that awful.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;He refused all treatments and chose to simply die at our home, peacefully. In reality, he simply screamed orders at my mother all day long since he rarely left his bed. He had a colostomy and it disgusted him profoundly until he died.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;For a little while, I thought it would be better with my mother now that he was gone but obviously, her problems weren\u2019t caused entirely by him. She mourned for him for years like a normal widow, but in an excessive manner. She stopped making meals altogether but continued buying the same groceries as when we were three in the house, letting a lot of the food spoil.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;BDSM&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;That\u2019s roughly when I started dating a guy who was into BDSM. Sorry it took so long to get there.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;He was one of the guys who used to give me drugs but he liked to have it a little rougher. We started visiting a local BDSM dungeon where he would tie me up and whip me or spank me.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;In the beginning, I thought it was weird, but it was something to do and he really seemed to like me. Plus, I was stoned most of the time and barely felt anything.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I wouldn\u2019t say I was his girlfriend or anything serious like that. He was just a guy I frequently saw.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Alone in the dungeon&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But one day, the dungeon master became furious when he saw weeds and pills in my partner\u2019s bags and expulsed and banned him, leaving me alone in the club.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I should have followed him, but I guess I was already too stoned to do so. I met a few people. I can\u2019t say I had ever presented myself before and felt accepted by them. A few weeks later, I began returning alone, if only to feel welcomed somewhere.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I had dropped out of high school by then and didn\u2019t know anything about anything. I couldn\u2019t do the laundry, I couldn\u2019t really cook, I couldn\u2019t talk politely enough to work anywhere. I simply was a reject of society, a complete wreck.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Of course, back then, I couldn\u2019t realize any of that. I couldn\u2019t see that soon enough I would most likely be left alone on the streets by my mother to become either a prostitute or yet another homeless girl begging for change.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Enter Frank&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But I met Frank (fake name). Frank was one of the masters visiting the dungeon. He was single but he wanted a full time slave girl to live with him. He gave classes on bondage and safety in BDSM and helped a lot of people, but he didn\u2019t want a girl to play from time to time. He wanted a full time slave to keep in his loft in a committed relationship.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I think he had noticed me the first time I went to the dungeon with my ex, but perhaps he looked at all girls as possible future slaves.\nAll I know was that he paid a lot of attention to me when I was there alone. He did a lot of bondage demonstrations using me as a model and even practiced his suspensions on me which I kind of liked.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I had stopped seeing my ex since he had gotten banned and I was now cut off from my supply of both drugs and sex to get my mind off of my solitude.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Accepting the proposition&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;So I began to open to him and one day, after he proposed for the 40th time or so to have me as a slave full time, I simply said yes.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I didn\u2019t know what I was getting into, but I didn\u2019t care. I had nothing in front of me and my mother hadn\u2019t spoken to me in weeks.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I left with him to reach his loft. It\u2019s in an old industrial building. It\u2019s a unit in the middle, without windows or interior walls. It only has a small kitchenette in one of the corners and a small industrial bathroom: there was a man\u2019s restroom with a urinal and a booth for a toilet, but the toilet in the woman\u2019s section had been replaced by a shower.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The rest of the loft was occupied mostly by home-made bondage equipment, apart for a king size bed.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;He told me that he wanted a house slave. That I could leave anytime I wanted by saying my safe-word but that until then, I wouldn\u2019t be allowed to leave his loft unless I needed to see a doctor. We went over my limits but I am not sure I was really sure of what I was getting into. I mostly checked no on his list on a few things I was scared off, stuff like branding and needles or tattoos. He did have to explain a few of them to me.\nI guess today that my motivation was mostly to live somewhere with someone who would care for me and Frank was the closest I could find. We talked a lot and the next day we went to my house so I could pick up my things and say goodbye to my mother who was obviously unconcerned that I was moving away.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It\u2019s only when we came back to his loft that I began my 16 month journey\u2026&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;My beginning as a slave&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Frank carefully helped me pack my few things in boxes for storage and in all seriousness, asked me to strip naked.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;At first, I felt ashamed, but a few soothing words from Frank helped me calm down. He boxed my clothes too and I ended up not wearing anything until the day I decided it was enough, 16 months later.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Well, I did wear panties during my periods, but otherwise, I was fully naked around the clock, for more than a year.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Frank works in a factory on shifts. He sometimes works the night shift, sometimes works the day shift, etc\u2026&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;One of the first things he did was get rid of all calendars and clocks in the house, keeping only his watch and his cellphone for any time references. He didn\u2019t have a computer or a TV or even a radio so even if I wanted to know the time or the date when he was away at work, it was impossible. He didn\u2019t even have a phone at home, using only his cellphone for communications.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;At first, our relationship was like most other couples in that we engaged in conversation, had lots of sex with the added kinkiness of me being suspended or tied or even whipped from time to time.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Quickly, as time went by however, it was expected that I would behave more and more like a slave and with less and less freedom of will. He was slowly helping me let go of my resistance to obedience, as he said it.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Getting used to it&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Gradually, I began to enjoy it. When he was there, he would train me in doing whatever he wanted me to do, including cooking, cleaning the loft or servicing him sexually. When he wasn\u2019t there, I was left instructions on what to do, like meditation or even just stretching exercises.\nRapidly, I lost track of time and Frank insisted that this was his goal. He wanted me to fully rely on him for all information.\nI realized that sometimes, a Wednesday would follow a Thursday, but I was expected to just accept it and soon enough, I stopped asking or caring about which day we were.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Today, I realize he was almost brainwashing me, but like my mother, I didn\u2019t see any alternatives. I was warm, I was secure, I was loved and unlike her, the few times I was hit I actually welcomed and enjoyed it as it was usually followed by some of the best sex I ever had.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Several times, he invited friends over and no, I was not allowed to dress back up. Most of the people were friends I knew from the dungeon, but I was usually expected to play a certain role, like remain silent for the evening and simply serve food for everything or even just remain on all four and serve as a human footrest for the whole evening.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Only twice did someone else had sex with me, thought in one of the cases, I have no idea if it was really someone else.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Long term roles&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;You see, some of the things he did were long term rules or roles. I once did pet play for a full month (well roughly three weeks), from the end of my periods to the beginning of the next one. I played the role of the puppy night and day.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But the worst part for me to endure were the 3 weeks or so I spent blindfolded. Not once in those 3 weeks was I allowed to see anything, but I was expected to continue to follow my routine.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;At first, I hit everything and I did think to cheat while he was at work, but I remained faithful and spent the whole period blindfolded. During that time, Frank received friends over and I had sex with someone but I am not sure if it wasn\u2019t Frank himself. It sure felt familiar.\nThe other time was for a threesome.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Eventually, he kept pushing more and more. His little stint with the blindfold was notable one of the tipping points. For days after the removal, I was hypersensitive to light and the Chilean miner crisis recently showed me there was a real danger to his fetish. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Getting out&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;One day, he decided to tie me to his cross like he often did and I just said my safe-word. I had enough. I had been forbidden to talk for the previous few months and I no longer felt good about myself like in the beginning. I had forgotten who I was, what I wanted and simply couldn\u2019t take it \nanymore.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;He confirmed that was what I wanted and brought me some of my clothes to put on my pale carcass. Without any sunlight in 16 months, my skin had never been so white, and I had lost quite a lot of weight under his care.\nHe didn\u2019t drop me on the street like I was afraid he would do or like my mom told me men acted when you said no to them. He asked me the date I thought we were and I was off by a good 3 months, under evaluating my stay. I had just missed my second birthday while in his presence and I was now 20 years old.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I had left the dungeon that night on a hot summer day and when I came out, snow was everywhere.\nWe found my mother but I discovered she didn\u2019t even care where I had been or that we hadn\u2019t spoken for that long. The three of us ate supper without even speaking a word.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I stayed with Frank for another 5 months but I wasn\u2019t his slave anymore. We did continue to have sex and even do a little BDSM play but we were back to the talking phase we had in the beginning. We spoke a lot about what I had gone through and I shared all my thoughts and emotions. He apologized for the last part where he asked me to stay silent for so long.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;He mostly wanted to be sure he didn\u2019t somehow break me or traumatize me.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;He tried to convince me to try it again, but it was behind me now. I had others things to do even if I had no idea what.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Finding a job and moving out&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Two months after I said my safe-word, I found a job in a burger joint, not a big chain but a mom and pop store where I was a waitress serving greasy burgers.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Three months later, Frank and I agreed it would be better if I moved so he helped me find a small apartment and even paid for the first few months to help me get on track, allowing me to find used furniture and even all of the appliances.\nWe stayed in touch for a while, but he was busy finding my replacement. When he did, he stopped calling me as he was now busy with his new slave. I had met her. She wanted to confirm that Frank wasn\u2019t a psycho and I reassured her that I was fine. Frank promised he wouldn\u2019t do the same mistakes he did with me.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Now&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I eventually made a new boyfriend, a regular customer at my restaurant, and now I am the receptionist for the office he works for.\nSomehow, what happened in those 16 months almost helped me reboot my life. I don\u2019t think it was because of the BDSM itself, but perhaps it was simply because someone had loved me and taken care of me almost like a child for the first time in my life.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Conclusion&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;What scares me today from time to time is that if he hadn\u2019t begun to impose long term rules like the no speaking part, I might still be there, without the attention of a dentist and slowly losing sense of who I was.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But I grew out of that and slowly defined who I was and what I wanted and didn\u2019t want and even learned today to say no to my boyfriend, something my mother was never able to do.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Summary&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;If you didn&amp;#39;t want to read, here is a summary:&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;ul&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;I was an accident and my parents ignored me all my life&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;desperate for attention, I slept with boys who gave me drugs&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;I eventually dated a guy who was into BDSM and when he was kicked out of the dungeon, continued going&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Frank asked me to be a full time slave at this loft and I eventually said yes&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;I spent 16 months naked at his loft as a slave, slowly almost being brainwashed&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;One day, I said it was enough and moved out&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ul&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;UPDATE Friday Morning&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I am trying to answer the questions I didn&amp;#39;t get. I didn&amp;#39;t fight with my boyfriend (but he did get a BJ). Here are some of the most asked questions:&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;ul&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;The safeword was &amp;quot;MacGyver&amp;quot;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;No, I no longer do BDSM&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;I was with Frank from August 2002 to January 2004, so it was 7 years ago&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Since then, I returned to high school and turned my life around&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;I didn&amp;#39;t take any drugs since the night my ex was banned, so I didn&amp;#39;t take any with Frank&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;I was 18 when I said yes to Frank. Not 16 like some understood.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;the problem with Dental care is because my current boyfriend is obsessed with his teeth, but I didn&amp;#39;t realize it was an unhealthy obsession&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Yes, I will try to write a novel about my experience&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ul&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;", "text": "**New !

A few weeks later, I began returning alone, if only to feel welcomed somewhere.\n\nI had dropped out of high school by then and didn\u2019t know anything about anything. I couldn\u2019t do the laundry, I couldn\u2019t really cook, I couldn\u2019t talk politely enough to work anywhere. I simply was a reject of society, a complete wreck.\n\nOf course, back then, I couldn\u2019t realize any of that. I couldn\u2019t see that soon enough I would most likely be left alone on the streets by my mother to become either a prostitute or yet another homeless girl begging for change.\n\n**Enter Frank**\n\nBut I met Frank (fake name). Frank was one of the masters visiting the dungeon. He was single but he wanted a full time slave girl to live with him. He gave classes on bondage and safety in BDSM and helped a lot of people, but he didn\u2019t want a girl to play from time to time. He wanted a full time slave to keep in his loft in a committed relationship.\n\nI think he had noticed me the first time I went to the dungeon with my ex, but perhaps he looked at all girls as possible future slaves.\nAll I know was that he paid a lot of attention to me when I was there alone. He did a lot of bondage demonstrations using me as a model and even practiced his suspensions on me which I kind of liked.\n\nI had stopped seeing my ex since he had gotten banned and I was now cut off from my supply of both drugs and sex to get my mind off of my solitude.\n\n**Accepting the proposition**\n\nSo I began to open to him and one day, after he proposed for the 40th time or so to have me as a slave full time, I simply said yes.\n\nI didn\u2019t know what I was getting into, but I didn\u2019t care. I had nothing in front of me and my mother hadn\u2019t spoken to me in weeks.\n\nI left with him to reach his loft. It\u2019s in an old industrial building. It\u2019s a unit in the middle, without windows or interior walls. It only has a small kitchenette in one of the corners and a small industrial bathroom: there was a man\u2019s restroom with a urinal and a booth for a toilet, but the toilet in the woman\u2019s section had been replaced by a shower.\n\nThe rest of the loft was occupied mostly by home-made bondage equipment, apart for a king size bed.\n\nHe told me that he wanted a house slave. That I could leave anytime I wanted by saying my safe-word but that until then, I wouldn\u2019t be allowed to leave his loft unless I needed to see a doctor. We went over my limits but I am not sure I was really sure of what I was getting into. I mostly checked no on his list on a few things I was scared off, stuff like branding and needles or tattoos. He did have to explain a few of them to me.\nI guess today that my motivation was mostly to live somewhere with someone who would care for me and Frank was the closest I could find. We talked a lot and the next day we went to my house so I could pick up my things and say goodbye to my mother who was obviously unconcerned that I was moving away.\n\nIt\u2019s only when we came back to his loft that I began my 16 month journey\u2026\n\n**My beginning as a slave**\n\nFrank carefully helped me pack my few things in boxes for storage and in all seriousness, asked me to strip naked.\n\nAt first, I felt ashamed, but a few soothing words from Frank helped me calm down. He boxed my clothes too and I ended up not wearing anything until the day I decided it was enough, 16 months later.\n\nWell, I did wear panties during my periods, but otherwise, I was fully naked around the clock, for more than a year.\n\nFrank works in a factory on shifts. He sometimes works the night shift, sometimes works the day shift, etc\u2026\n\nOne of the first things he did was get rid of all calendars and clocks in the house, keeping only his watch and his cellphone for any time references. He didn\u2019t have a computer or a TV or even a radio so even if I wanted to know the time or the date when he was away at work, it was impossible. He didn\u2019t even have a phone at home, using only his cellphone for communications.\n\nAt first, our relationship was like most other couples in that we engaged in conversation, had lots of sex with the added kinkiness of me being suspended or tied or even whipped from time to time.\n\nQuickly, as time went by however, it was expected that I would behave more and more like a slave and with less and less freedom of will. He was slowly helping me let go of my resistance to obedience, as he said it.\n\n**Getting used to it**\n\nGradually, I began to enjoy it. When he was there, he would train me in doing whatever he wanted me to do, including cooking, cleaning the loft or servicing him sexually. When he wasn\u2019t there, I was left instructions on what to do, like meditation or even just stretching exercises.\nRapidly, I lost track of time and Frank insisted that this was his goal. He wanted me to fully rely on him for all information.\nI realized that sometimes, a Wednesday would follow a Thursday, but I was expected to just accept it and soon enough, I stopped asking or caring about which day we were.\n\nToday, I realize he was almost brainwashing me, but like my mother, I didn\u2019t see any alternatives. I was warm, I was secure, I was loved and unlike her, the few times I was hit I actually welcomed and enjoyed it as it was usually followed by some of the best sex I ever had.\n\nSeveral times, he invited friends over and no, I was not allowed to dress back up. Most of the people were friends I knew from the dungeon, but I was usually expected to play a certain role, like remain silent for the evening and simply serve food for everything or even just remain on all four and serve as a human footrest for the whole evening.\n\nOnly twice did someone else had sex with me, thought in one of the cases, I have no idea if it was really someone else.\n\n**Long term roles**\n\nYou see, some of the things he did were long term rules or roles. I once did pet play for a full month (well roughly three weeks), from the end of my periods to the beginning of the next one. I played the role of the puppy night and day.\n\nBut the worst part for me to endure were the 3 weeks or so I spent blindfolded. Not once in those 3 weeks was I allowed to see anything, but I was expected to continue to follow my routine.\n\nAt first, I hit everything and I did think to cheat while he was at work, but I remained faithful and spent the whole period blindfolded. During that time, Frank received friends over and I had sex with someone but I am not sure if it wasn\u2019t Frank himself. It sure felt familiar.\nThe other time was for a threesome.\n\nEventually, he kept pushing more and more. His little stint with the blindfold was notable one of the tipping points. For days after the removal, I was hypersensitive to light and the Chilean miner crisis recently showed me there was a real danger to his fetish. \n\n**Getting out**\n\nOne day, he decided to tie me to his cross like he often did and I just said my safe-word. I had enough. I had been forbidden to talk for the previous few months and I no longer felt good about myself like in the beginning. I had forgotten who I was, what I wanted and simply couldn\u2019t take it \nanymore.\n\nHe confirmed that was what I wanted and brought me some of my clothes to put on my pale carcass. Without any sunlight in 16 months, my skin had never been so white, and I had lost quite a lot of weight under his care.\nHe didn\u2019t drop me on the street like I was afraid he would do or like my mom told me men acted when you said no to them. He asked me the date I thought we were and I was off by a good 3 months, under evaluating my stay. I had just missed my second birthday while in his presence and I was now 20 years old.\n\nI had left the dungeon that night on a hot summer day and when I came out, snow was everywhere.\nWe found my mother but I discovered she didn\u2019t even care where I had been or that we hadn\u2019t spoken for that long. The three of us ate supper without even speaking a word.\n\nI stayed with Frank for another 5 months but I wasn\u2019t his slave anymore. We did continue to have sex and even do a little BDSM play but we were back to the talking phase we had in the beginning. We spoke a lot about what I had gone through and I shared all my thoughts and emotions. He apologized for the last part where he asked me to stay silent for so long.\n\nHe mostly wanted to be sure he didn\u2019t somehow break me or traumatize me.\n\nHe tried to convince me to try it again, but it was behind me now. I had others things to do even if I had no idea what.\n\n**Finding a job and moving out**\n\nTwo months after I said my safe-word, I found a job in a burger joint, not a big chain but a mom and pop store where I was a waitress serving greasy burgers.\n\nThree months later, Frank and I agreed it would be better if I moved so he helped me find a small apartment and even paid for the first few months to help me get on track, allowing me to find used furniture and even all of the appliances.\nWe stayed in touch for a while, but he was busy finding my replacement. When he did, he stopped calling me as he was now busy with his new slave. I had met her. She wanted to confirm that Frank wasn\u2019t a psycho and I reassured her that I was fine. Frank promised he wouldn\u2019t do the same mistakes he did with me.\n\n**Now**\n\nI eventually made a new boyfriend, a regular customer at my restaurant, and now I am the receptionist for the office he works for.\nSomehow, what happened in those 16 months almost helped me reboot my life. I don\u2019t think it was because of the BDSM itself, but perhaps it was simply because someone had loved me and taken care of me almost like a child for the first time in my life.\n\n**Conclusion**\n\nWhat scares me today from time to time is that if he hadn\u2019t begun to impose long term rules like the no speaking part, I might still be there, without the attention of a dentist and slowly losing sense of who I was.\n\nBut I grew out of that and slowly defined who I was and what I wanted and didn\u2019t want and even learned today to say no to my boyfriend, something my mother was never able to do.\n\n**Summary**\n\nIf you didn't want to read, here is a summary:\n\n- I was an accident and my parents ignored me all my life\n- desperate for attention, I slept with boys who gave me drugs\n- I eventually dated a guy who was into BDSM and when he was kicked out of the dungeon, continued going\n- Frank asked me to be a full time slave at this loft and I eventually said yes\n- I spent 16 months naked at his loft as a slave, slowly almost being brainwashed\n- One day, I said it was enough and moved out\n\n**UPDATE Friday Morning**\n\n\nI am trying to answer the questions I didn't get. I didn't fight with my boyfriend (but he did get a BJ). Here are some of the most asked questions:\n\n- The safeword was \"MacGyver\"\n- No, I no longer do BDSM\n- I was with Frank from August 2002 to January 2004, so it was 7 years ago\n- Since then, I returned to high school and turned my life around\n- I didn't take any drugs since the night my ex was banned, so I didn't take any with Frank\n- I was 18 when I said yes to Frank. Not 16 like some understood.\n- the problem with Dental care is because my current boyfriend is obsessed with his teeth, but I didn't realize it was an unhealthy obsession\n- Yes, I will try to write a novel about my experience", "ups": 8515}, {"permalink": "http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/flp9d/i_am_a_dominant_in_a_247_bdsm_relationship_ama/", "short_link": "http://redd.it/flp9d", "author": {"has_mail": null, "name": "terrible_damage", "created": 1280798814.0, "created_utc": 1280798814.0, "link_karma": 185, "comment_karma": 694, "is_gold": false, "is_mod": false, "id": "485q8", "has_mod_mail": null}, "title": "I am a Dominant in a 24/7 BDSM relationship AMA (NSFW)", "num_comments": 515, "downs": 517, "created": 1297755350.0, "created_utc": 1297755350.0, "subreddit": {"display_name": "IAmA", "description": "### **Ask the OPs to provide proof, and upvote those who do!** ###\n\nIAmA = \"I am a\"\n\nAMA = \"Ask me anything\"\n\nAMAA = \"Ask me almost anything\"\n\n# Upcoming IAmAs\n\n\n|Date|Time|Person|Attraction|\n|:---:|:----:|:----:|:---:|\n|TBD|Rescheduled|Marty Baron|Editor, *Boston Globe*|\n|1 May|[Live now!](http://reddit.com/t1ygb)|Paul Krugman|Economist, *New York Times* columnist|\n|2 May|3PM (ET)|Terry Phillips|Congressional candidate|\n|3 May|4:30 PM (EST)|Alex Foster| SNL Saxophonist|\n|4 May|11:00 AM (ET)|David Frum|[Bush Speechwriter and Political Commentator](http://www.thedailybeast.com/articles/2012/04/27/reddit-ama.html)|\n|4 May|1PM (ET)|Keiran Lee|Male Pornographic Actor|\n|11 MAY|6PM (ET)| Tenacious D|Comedy rock duo|\n|15 May|2PM (ET)|Adam Carolla|Radio show host|\n|TBD|TBD|Ricky Gervais|Comedian|\n# Verification System\n\n* **You must** provide proof of your identity **in the body of your post** when you submit your IAmA\n\n* If your identity is absolutely confidential, you may [message proof to the mods](http://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=%23IAmA)\n\n* If your post is suspected fake and you do not verify proof, it may be subject to removal\n\n# IAmAs Should Focus On:\n\n* Something uncommon that plays a central role in your life -or-\n\n* A truly interesting and unique event (Ex: I climbed Mt.

But I really doubt it.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;We have sex, but she&amp;#39;s not that much into it. Anorgasmia and asexuality play a role here too. She agrees that there are probably two sides in her. One that desires what I provide and another that wants something dirty. Yes, I&amp;#39;ve tried being more aggressive (spanking, squeezes, etc) with her, but it felt fake.

In other words, enthusiam. Even if you don&amp;#39;t know what to do at first just experiment...I sucked like a vacuum my first time and he thought it was funny, but then he came really hard.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Learn about his cock. Every single cock has different thresholds for pleasure and pain. I&amp;#39;ve experienced extremes from men that are so sensitive I couldn&amp;#39;t even touch their balls, to one man that wanted me to slap and bite them. The best blow jobs are tailored to each man. No great blow job is the same on every man.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;For long pleasurable blow jobs mix it up. Example: Suck slowly for a while and take in as much as you can and hold it at the back of your throat (or however far back you can) and then go back to sucking just the head. Vary the speed, pressure...using hands, not using hands...touching the balls, touching under them etc etc...&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Lips wrapped over the teeth is less tiring (you don&amp;#39;t have to open your jaw as much to avoid teeth getting in the way) and gives the guy more pressure when sucking.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Lots and lots of saliva. If you don&amp;#39;t produce enough, use lube!&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;If you have a gag reflex, remember tip #1. Then realize that you can still learn to deep throat and get face fucked if you want to. If you don&amp;#39;t want to that&amp;#39;s ok too as you can still give a great blowjob without that....but if you do want to then enthusiasm helps the most. Love the cock your sucking and tell him you need his patience and then proceed to take just enough in before you want to gag and then hold it there!! Then come back up and try it again, or if you feel like puking switch to a hand job for a while.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Keep exploring/experimenting if you don&amp;#39;t know what he likes. If your man is comfortable with your fingers behind his balls, keep going back to his anus...Don&amp;#39;t EVER put anything in man&amp;#39;s ass without asking. That&amp;#39;s wrong! But reassuring him that you will go slow and just touch the outside is usually ok (if it&amp;#39;s not then just stop for now and go back to what you were doing before). Some men will slowly let you to the point of fingering his ass while sucking his cock and then giving him one of the best blow jobs ever...&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;If his cock is curved, then GO WITH THE CURVE. If he curves sideways then you can lay on your side and suck him from his side. If his cock curves up then you can try sucking him with your head over the edge of the bed. If his cock curves down then try him standing and you on your knees. Etc!&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Combo of hands and mouth = great blowjob. You don&amp;#39;t need to just use your mouth and that&amp;#39;s it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Says he can&amp;#39;t cum from a blowjob? That usually means he needs a woman with lots of practice in the stamina department, but it&amp;#39;s possible. He usually just needs a steady rhythm that never stops.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Some men need to face fuck in order to cum. That doesn&amp;#39;t mean it has to be all the way down your throat. Sometimes all that means is just the head going in and out. You can actually use your tongue to make him stop going further than you want to and that gives him the feeling that he&amp;#39;s bottomed out anyways!&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Want to swallow for him but don&amp;#39;t think you can? It&amp;#39;s easier to swallow it when you can&amp;#39;t taste it. So take him in as much as you can (which I know sounds counter intuitive) and you will feel warm stuff at the back of your throat, but not the taste as much. Also spitting it out is perfectly fine, because after he&amp;#39;s cum he&amp;#39;s done. It&amp;#39;s not going to matter too much unless swallowing is his fetish. Either way, he should respect that you don&amp;#39;t feel comfortable swallowing&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Have fun with both blow jobs that are empowering (where you have control etc) and blow jobs that are sometimes seen as degrading. It&amp;#39;s just sex and play. He doesn&amp;#39;t view you as less of an equal just because he wants to cum on your face. He&amp;#39;s just letting his animalistic side out.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dirty talk and the eyes!! Give your mouth a break, use your hands and start talking to him. Look at him and then go back down...and then look at him again while you are sucking! This is so much more powerful than women realize.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Maybe this should be number one...but tease him. Don&amp;#39;t just put your mouth on his cock straight away. Kiss around it, lick his balls etc etc...&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Surprise. It&amp;#39;s fun to do the same thing for a long time, and then use a technique that you know he&amp;#39;ll love just out of the blue. Listen for his breathing and moaning...it&amp;#39;s pretty cool when this makes him say, &amp;quot;oh my god!!! yes!! wow!!&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;For guys whose cock isn&amp;#39;t too sensitive and can handle this: after he [cums], don&amp;#39;t let go immediately. If you can, keep your mouth on there and hold his cock with your hand. It&amp;#39;ll prolong the nice feeling. If you drop everything on the spot the sensations are POOF...gone.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ol&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Edit: Added tip #17 from El Dude with my own precaution.&lt;/em&gt; &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Edit #2: Some guys just DON&amp;#39;T EVER cum from a blowjob. Cumming from a blowjob IS NOT always the point of the blowjob!!!

I always appreciate knowing that. I can adjust my technique and mindset accordingly....if he&amp;#39;s lying then he&amp;#39;s just going to cum really fast or ask me to tone it down so he can last longer.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Edit #4 (hopefully last one): If you lie and tell a girl you can&amp;#39;t cum from blow jobs, she will either give up and expect to just move on...or she&amp;#39;ll accept the challenge because she loves giving blowjobs. Essentially, you won&amp;#39;t be tricking the girl who doesn&amp;#39;t like them to not even try, and the girl that loves them to try just a little harder.

The purpose of such links is to save room, which isn't an issue when making a post.
