Simple enough. Request one in the comments section. To establish damage control on potential scammers, we would like for you to &lt;strong&gt;post a pic of yourself with a sign reading \u201cRAOP, will you be my Valentine?\u201d&lt;/strong&gt; Also be sure to include your name, date, weight, height, professor\u2019s name, course number\u2014whatever. Get creative; it\u2019s encouraged here at RAoP after all. Take a pic of yourself all dressed up, ladies can do an undressed version, do something funny, or take one with your cat (don\u2019t lie, we know you have one). This is &lt;em&gt;not&lt;/em&gt; a joke or a gimmick, nor are we poking fun at your single status. We just want to see the smiling faces of all the peeps getting pizza.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;One of the fine people mentioned above will contact your (either via comment reply or PM) and request your info so they can give you that pizza we\u2019ve been talking about. If one or more givers responds to you, please calm the fuck down. This does not mean you get two pizzas. The two givers fighting over you will settle who\u2019s gets to do the giving in a civil and cordial manner\u2014either a rock, paper, scissors match via messages (best of three), or a duel on the following morning (one pistol, one bullet, ten paces). To avoid the previously mentioned conflicts. &lt;strong&gt;Givers: if you have already gifted a pizza, please be sure to highlight this in the comments section under said requestor (i.e., pizzad, gave it to this guy, suck it hunger, whatever), so we know they have already received.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Protip:&lt;/strong&gt; If you can decide on the pizza chain you want, know your email address, and have the verification code (see sidebar) ready ahead of time, your giver can get you your pizza faster. After all this is sorted out, you\u2019ll receive your $10 gift card. Like Pasta, I also work and go to school, so I\u2019m actually forgoing sleep at the moment just to try and give a few out before I go to work. Also, we\u2019re employing the 24-hour account rule for this giveaway to further deter scammers.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Couples&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;We haven\u2019t forgotten about you; don\u2019t worry, we want to show you some love too. Since there\u2019s two of you (and if my math is correct), couples get $20 cards. For couples, you will also need to post a pic holding the aforementioned sign, &lt;em&gt;however&lt;/em&gt;, since I don\u2019t want the single people trying to get $20 cards by taking pictures with their mom, sister, cousin, uncle, etc., &lt;strong&gt;your  picture must include you and your significant other showing each other &lt;em&gt;physical&lt;/em&gt; (operative word here) affection&lt;/strong&gt;. Kissing, groping, banging (probably won\u2019t be allowed by the mods, but you can still send them my way if you want\u2026&lt;em&gt;rubs hands together deviously&lt;/em&gt;), whatever\u2014just show us that you\u2019re into each other. Same process, someone contacts you, you send them info, you get pizza. Givers: wash, rinse, repeat.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;As one who is familiar with mass giveaways, I know there will be people clamoring for pizzas like a heard of zombies hungering for human flesh. Not too long ago, I attempted (rather stupidly, I might add) to conduct one on my own. Needless to say, I was overwhelmed in a matter minutes, receiving no less than a dozen messages every other minute. But now, I have an army of dedicated RAoPers at my back. More people will get pizza, more bellies will be filled. And if I told you the combined monetary pool we\u2019ve put together for this event, you\u2019d shit your pants, clean yourself up, change pants, then shit yourself again. There may be many of you seeking pizza, but we are dedicated, resilient, and mere overwhelming numbers won\u2019t stop us.  You will break upon this post as water on rock. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;As King Th\u00e9oden, son of Thengel, said: &lt;em&gt;\u201cLet them come.\u201d&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Also, we checked the fridge and pantry, and we\u2019re fresh out of fucks\u2014we\u2019re giving out pizza, bitches.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;TL;DR:&lt;/strong&gt; Start at the top.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Special thanks&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I would first like to take the time to thank all you givers (27!) who took time out of your day and money out of your pockets to help with this cause. Each and every one of you are more generous than most of the people I\u2019ve come across in real life.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;My deepest thanks and gratitude to &lt;a href=\"http://www.reddit.com/user/RobSpewack\"&gt;RobSpewack&lt;/a&gt; for coming up with the whole Valentine\u2019s Day giveaway idea. If anyone who gets a pizza today feels compelled to pay it forward in the future, give it to this guy\u2014he deserves it. He was the one who originally pitched the brilliant idea when I was mentally toying around with planning a collaborative giveaway a couple months back. If he hadn\u2019t done so, I would\u2019ve ended up haphazardly hosting this event on some meaningless day. Seriously, Rob, I can\u2019t thank you enough.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I would also like to thank &lt;a href=\"http://www.reddit.com/user/DownSouthDread\"&gt;DownSouthDread&lt;/a&gt; who helped me with the promotional aspects, details, expanding the team, and host of other factors I probably would\u2019ve overlooked had he not brought them to my attention. He really helped nail down the whole \u201chow\u201d aspect to this endeavor and I really don\u2019t know how I would\u2019ve figured this thing out without him.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=\"http://www.reddit.com/user/Glinda_Da_Good_Witch\"&gt;Glinda_Da_Good_Witch&lt;/a&gt;. Glinda, oh Glinda, where do I even begin. When I first contacted her she asked how many people I had signed up. I told her, and she replied that she had a few contacts she would try getting on board. Not even thirty minutes later, she messaged me with a list of givers to add to the list. Then more the following day. This woman can round up people like sheep. However she does it, I can only imagine that there\u2019s a fair amount of magic involved.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Last but not least, let\u2019s give it up for our fearless mods, &lt;a href=\"http://www.reddit.com/user/Gadianton\"&gt;Gadianton&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"http://www.reddit.com/user/snang\"&gt;snang&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"http://www.reddit.com/user/Cayuscokid\"&gt;Cayuscokid&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"http://www.reddit.com/user/Rollout\"&gt;Rollout&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"http://www.reddit.com/user/moshimoochi\"&gt;moshimoochi&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"http://www.reddit.com/user/PastafarianTwit\"&gt;PastafarianTwit&lt;/a&gt;, who were gracious enough to lend their hands to this cause.

People I&amp;#39;m still waiting on to hear back on, I&amp;#39;ll check in from time to time. Other givers, have at it.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Edit3: Just checking in on break, looking good so far. Keep up the good work givers. Also, all you foreveralone folks, after browsing all of your pics, how the hell are &lt;em&gt;any&lt;/em&gt; of you single? You&amp;#39;re all gorgeous!&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Edit4: Quick check in on break. Good news for requestors, to be honest, I don&amp;#39;t even think we&amp;#39;ve given away half of what we pooled together.

Pizza and internet dating: the best of both worlds!&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Edit5: Hey eensy weensy scroll bar, FUCK YOU.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;", "text": "Yeah, it\u2019s *that* time of year again.  \n\nThe one day out of the year florists and chocolatiers make over 40% of their annual gross income in a single 24-hour period. Unfortunately for the single population out there, this is the one day hand-crafted by fate\u2019s ugly hands to simply remind them of their single status, and once again pierce their hearts with that infernal sword of loneliness. It sucks, I know \u2013 I\u2019ve been there. Being single on Valentine\u2019s Day is akin to spending Christmas or New Year\u2019s alone; not fun. But don\u2019t worry, my lonely friends. RAoP is here to help you. This Valentine\u2019s Day won\u2019t suck, at least, not *as* much.\n\nTo put it simply, this is a Valentine\u2019s Day giveaway\u2014one of colossal proportions. In fact, it\u2019s so big, we had to stretch it out over the entire day. Ah, \u201cwe?\u201d you might ask? Yes. WE\u2013**WE.** As you read on, you\u2019ll see just how many people came together in a selfless effort to make your Valentine\u2019s Day less shitty. Before you continue on to the part where you read the guidelines (which, so help me, you *will* read) on how to acquire your pizza, please take the time to recognize this all-star squad of RAoPers who are taking the time to serve you.\n\nThe roster, in no particular order:\n\n[PastafarianTwit](http://www.reddit.com/user/PastafarianTwit), [DownSouthDread](http://www.reddit.com/user/DownSouthDread), [RobSpewack](http://www.reddit.com/user/RobSpewack), [Glinda_Da_Good_Witch](http://www.reddit.com/user/Glinda_Da_Good_Witch), [jetboyterp](http://www.reddit.com/user/jetboyterp), [badbrownie](http://www.reddit.com/user/badbrownie), [chupanibre25](http://www.reddit.com/user/chupanibre25), [toncinap](http://www.reddit.com/user/toncinap), [overripebanana](http://www.reddit.com/user/overripebanana), [Gadianton](http://www.reddit.com/user/Gadianton), [moshimoochi](http://www.reddit.com/user/moshimoochi), [tanyagal2](http://www.reddit.com/user/tanyagal2), [CheeseGamer](http://www.reddit.com/user/CheeseGamer), [snang](http://www.reddit.com/user/snang), [Cayuscokid](http://www.reddit.com/user/Cayuscokid), [fordandt]( http://www.reddit.com/user/fordandt), [m2mu](http://www.reddit.com/user/m2mu), [kencater](http://www.reddit.com/user/kencater), [MonkeyHouse](http://www.reddit.com/user/MonkeyHouse), [Cacoo](http://www.reddit.com/user/Cacoo), [awana56](http://www.reddit.com/user/awana56), [aghos](http://www.reddit.com/user/aghos), [Madamrimbaud](http://www.reddit.com/user/Madamrimbaud), [Supersized](http://www.reddit.com/user/Supersized), [Coasttocoaster](http://www.reddit.com/user/Coasttocoaster), [TokenFemale](http://www.reddit.com/user/TokenFemale), [Drolsonator](http://www.reddit.com/user/Drolsonator)\n\n(Givers, *please* tell me if I missed your name.)\n\n**Guidelines**\n\nSo, you want a pizza, yes? Simple enough. Request one in the comments section. To establish damage control on potential scammers, we would like for you to **post a pic of yourself with a sign reading \u201cRAOP, will you be my Valentine?\u201d** Also be sure to include your name, date, weight, height, professor\u2019s name, course number\u2014whatever. Get creative; it\u2019s encouraged here at RAoP after all. Take a pic of yourself all dressed up, ladies can do an undressed version, do something funny, or take one with your cat (don\u2019t lie, we know you have one). This is *not* a joke or a gimmick, nor are we poking fun at your single status. We just want to see the smiling faces of all the peeps getting pizza.\n\nOne of the fine people mentioned above will contact your (either via comment reply or PM) and request your info so they can give you that pizza we\u2019ve been talking about. If one or more givers responds to you, please calm the fuck down. This does not mean you get two pizzas. The two givers fighting over you will settle who\u2019s gets to do the giving in a civil and cordial manner\u2014either a rock, paper, scissors match via messages (best of three), or a duel on the following morning (one pistol, one bullet, ten paces). To avoid the previously mentioned conflicts. **Givers: if you have already gifted a pizza, please be sure to highlight this in the comments section under said requestor (i.e., pizzad, gave it to this guy, suck it hunger, whatever), so we know they have already received.**\n\n**Protip:** If you can decide on the pizza chain you want, know your email address, and have the verification code (see sidebar) ready ahead of time, your giver can get you your pizza faster. After all this is sorted out, you\u2019ll receive your $10 gift card. Like Pasta, I also work and go to school, so I\u2019m actually forgoing sleep at the moment just to try and give a few out before I go to work. Also, we\u2019re employing the 24-hour account rule for this giveaway to further deter scammers.\n\n **Couples**\n\nWe haven\u2019t forgotten about you; don\u2019t worry, we want to show you some love too. Since there\u2019s two of you (and if my math is correct), couples get $20 cards. For couples, you will also need to post a pic holding the aforementioned sign, *however*, since I don\u2019t want the single people trying to get $20 cards by taking pictures with their mom, sister, cousin, uncle, etc., **your  picture must include you and your significant other showing each other *physical* (operative word here) affection**. Kissing, groping, banging (probably won\u2019t be allowed by the mods, but you can still send them my way if you want\u2026*rubs hands together deviously*), whatever\u2014just show us that you\u2019re into each other. Same process, someone contacts you, you send them info, you get pizza. Givers: wash, rinse, repeat.\n\nAs one who is familiar with mass giveaways, I know there will be people clamoring for pizzas like a heard of zombies hungering for human flesh. Not too long ago, I attempted (rather stupidly, I might add) to conduct one on my own. Needless to say, I was overwhelmed in a matter minutes, receiving no less than a dozen messages every other minute. But now, I have an army of dedicated RAoPers at my back. More people will get pizza, more bellies will be filled. And if I told you the combined monetary pool we\u2019ve put together for this event, you\u2019d shit your pants, clean yourself up, change pants, then shit yourself again. There may be many of you seeking pizza, but we are dedicated, resilient, and mere overwhelming numbers won\u2019t stop us.  You will break upon this post as water on rock. \n\nAs King Th\u00e9oden, son of Thengel, said: *\u201cLet them come.\u201d*\n\nAlso, we checked the fridge and pantry, and we\u2019re fresh out of fucks\u2014we\u2019re giving out pizza, bitches.\n\n**TL;DR:** Start at the top.\n\n**Special thanks**\n\nI would first like to take the time to thank all you givers (27!) who took time out of your day and money out of your pockets to help with this cause.
